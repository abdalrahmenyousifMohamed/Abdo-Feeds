    <h1>House Republicans Only Have One Way out of Their Government Funding Debacle</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 15 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Mike Johnson should have seen this coming. In October, the then backbencher became speaker of the House after far-right radicals ousted Kevin McCarthy for the  to keep the government open. Now Johnson is on the —for the crime of negotiating with Senate Democrats to keep the government open.More than a year into one of the  in American history, it is exceedingly clear that House Republicans both have no interest in governing and are themselves ungovernable. With the possible exception of Donald Trump, there is no one within the GOP who can keep its various factions in line. There is certainly no one within the current Republican House who has the political capital to strike a deal with Democrats to fulfill Congress’s most basic responsibility—keeping the government open—while retaining the necessary support from GOP members. Given that this is an election year, shutting down the government and having another protracted period in which there is no speaker of the House (or both!) would be an exceptionally bad look for Republicans, who are—again, theoretically—making the case to voters this fall that they should be trusted to control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But there is a simple, elegant solution that would keep the government open and likely benefit Republicans in the long run: Hand control of the House over to Democrats. Consider Johnson’s bind, which is the same one McCarthy faced. Republicans have an extraordinarily slim majority in the House; after George Santos’s December ouster and McCarthy’s retirement at the end of the year, it sits at just three votes. On January 21, that margin will  when Ohio Republican Bill Johnson retires. Because some within the GOP won’t vote for any spending deal that doesn’t contain draconian cuts, and because Democrats control the Senate and the White House, any agreement to keep the government open requires a bipartisan compromise.But compromise is anathema to many House Republicans. Rather than recognize reality—the absolute necessity of reaching across the aisle—they have embraced a fantasy: that their leader, not their slim majority, is the cause of their legislative incompetence. Johnson’s task is impossible: He has to keep the government open and keep his right flank happy. The problem is that he can’t do both. Thus, it seems increasingly inevitable that before too long either the government will shut down or Johnson will lose the gavel—or both. And whoever gets the gavel after Johnson will be in the same bind, probably with an even shorter leash. So the Republicans should unburden themselves of this responsibility, which they clearly can’t uphold anyway, and just give up the gavel to Democrats and dare them to do better.No, I don’t think the House GOP would ever do this, and yes, there are a few obvious caveats. Republicans have few—if any—legislative priorities, but they are  to investigate Joe Biden’s son Hunter in an attempt to deflect attention from Trump’s numerous criminal and civil trials. A Democrat, particularly current party leader Hakeem Jeffries, taking the gavel would not only be seen as a profound failure but as practically treasonous by the right-wing press. And yet, it’s hard to argue that it wouldn’t be preferable for House Republicans’ political goals to simply relinquish control. The government shutting down would be eminently bad for their chances of maintaining their narrow House majority; it would also likely damage Trump’s presidential chances, given that it would serve as a glaring reminder of the recklessness and incompetence of the Republican Party. Giving up control of the House would allow them to at least plead powerlessness. They could return to a defensive posture, accusing Biden and the Democrats of reckless spending, and wash their hands of any deal that funds the government through the 2024 election. As for the Hunter Biden investigation, there is an argument that holding off would benefit them politically as well. They could continue to prosecute the case in the media, as they have for the last four years, arguing that Democrats are covering up a massive corruption scandal—and promising once again to begin investigating the “Biden Crime Family” when they regain power. Holding off on the Hunter Biden investigation is beneficial in an additional way: They . Despite grandiose claims of President Biden raking in millions in bribes via his drug-addled son, they have produced no evidence. The investigation is a massive embarrassment, and continuing it will only reinforce how flimsy and politically motivated it is. It may even make voters sympathetic to the president. And when Trump’s criminal and civil trials begin to heat up, it may ultimately backfire, presenting a contrast between a Republican presidential nominee who is guilty of multiple crimes—fraud, sexual assault, insurrection, among others—and a Democratic presidential nominee who is the victim of a political witch hunt (a real one). If Jeffries is unpalatable to the handful of Republicans needed to make him speaker—which is highly likely—a compromise could be found, with the New York Democrat remaining party leader but someone else becoming speaker. Democrats could offer a centrist choice from their own ranks (someone like Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger) or pull a moderate with bipartisan appeal from outside the chamber. There is, after all, no requirement that the speaker of the House be a member of the House. A NeverTrump Republican—think Liz Cheney or John Kasich—would be another option, though it’s hard to imagine such a politician being elected, given the likely defections from progressive Democrats and Republicans terrified of angering Trump and Fox News. Members of Congress could even get creative: Mark Cuban just  and presumably has a fair amount of time on his hands. Yes, my tongue is firmly in cheek at this point. But for a year now, House Republicans have been caught in a repetitive, self-destructive cycle. There is a seeming belief that if they only select a different speaker they will magically get a different outcome: a funding deal that keeps the government open while shrinking its size dramatically. They should face the facts: This simply will not happen. There’s only one way out of their current predicament, which is to acknowledge, at long last, that they have no business running the House of Representatives. Doing so may be the only way for them to hold onto their majority. </p>

    <h1>Carbon Offsets (Taylor’s Version)</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 15 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The  of Taylor Swift’s spokesperson to December  that the pop star had generated 128 tons of carbon dioxide from private jet travel in just three months was simple: Before the start of her “Eras” tour in March 2023, “Taylor purchased more than double the carbon credits needed to offset all tour travel.”This was a striking story for a few reasons. First, 128 tons of carbon dioxide is roughly equivalent to the average annual emissions of 28 gas-powered cars or 16 homes, per an Environmental Protection Agency emissions equivalency . Second, the source for these figures has since disappeared from the internet: The emissions numbers were reportedly calculated by an Instagram page called , tracking journeys by her Desault Falcon 7x and Dessault Falcon 900. Shortly after major news outlets picked up the numbers, the page  from the social media site.But perhaps the most interesting aspect, from a climate perspective, is the pop star’s purchase of offsets to deflect criticism. In brief, carbon offset vendors claim to allow polluters to counteract emissions they generate by purchasing credits that correspond to emissions reductions elsewhere. Often, that means paying some entity—like a nonprofit or corporation—to preserve tracts of forests that would otherwise be cut down. Offsets are also sold by companies like Climeworks, which captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a process known as Direct Air Capture and stores it in geological formations. So which carbon offsets is Taylor Swift buying? Universal, Swift’s record label, did not respond to an inquiry as to where Swift had purchased the offsets. High-quality offsets are extraordinarily hard to come by, though. Over the last several years, the industry has been  over the validity of its claims: Are all of the lands companies claim to protect, for instance, actually in danger of being razed? Trees planted are also liable to die or be cut down at some point: While carbon generated by a private jet will remain in the atmosphere indefinitely, there’s virtually no way for credit vendors to ensure trees will stay standing for time immemorial. “The entire market is structured around a fundamental falsehood: that a ton of carbon we get from burning fossil fuels is identical to a ton of carbon stored in forests. That is 100 percent false,” Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, whose research focuses on carbon offsets and storage,  me in September. “If you store carbon for less time than it takes to stabilize temperatures, that storage does not have any climate benefit.”One recent study, still undergoing peer review as of last September, estimated that just 12 percent of offset projects “constitute real emissions reductions.” Another  published last fall by The Guardian and the nonprofit watchdog Corporate Accountability concluded that 78 percent of the top 50 carbon-offsetting projects are “likely junk.” Last month wasn’t the first time Swift’s jets have been in the news. A 2022 report from British “sustainability marketing firm” Yard named her the biggest celebrity polluter of the year. The firm found that Swift’s jet had spent the equivalent of  in the air during the first six months of that year. A spokesperson for the “Midnight” singer  at the time that Swift frequently loaned out her planes to be used by others. Many of the credits purchased by corporations—and potentially Swift—are validated by third parties meant to ensure those credits are legit. Those firms have also come under heavy fire. One 2023  revealed that at least 90 percent of credits approved by one of the largest third-party verifiers, claiming offset projects in rainforests, were worthless “phantom credits” that didn’t correspond to any reductions. (The subject of the investigation, a nongovernmental organization called Verra, has disputed the allegations.)There are  for companies or individuals that purchase offsets to publicly disclose where they come from. California passed a  last year, Assembly Bill 1305, requiring “entities” that do business in the state and that buy or sell carbon credits, to make that information available. There’s been  over whether the statute takes effect this year or in 2025, as the bill’s author has argued it does in recent weeks. Without additional information from Swift’s team, there’s little way of knowing whether Swift personally, Universal, or some other legal entity purchased the offsets, and, accordingly, whether whatever entity bought them would be subject to the new law once it takes effect.“If Swift or her companies have publicly claimed that the tour was carbon neutral or that it produced less climate impact than its actual emissions because of offset credit use, then arguably they have made a claim that is covered under AB 1305,” Cullenward, who advocated for the bill’s passage, told me over text. There’s still a  to be filled in as to whether Taylor Swift’s carbon offsets are legit, but she does seem eager to  her reputation as a climate villain. Swift might not need to come  in the end. Carbon offset buyers and sellers in the Golden State, however, know  that they’ll need to soon enough.</p>

    <h1>The Fourteenth Amendment Scolds Abetting Trump’s Return</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Sat, 13 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The media spent a large part of Donald Trump’s presidency waiting for the moment that he might . Like , they manned this post in spite of the fact that Trump had very specifically refused to comport with one of the central notions of the constitutional order: that there are . Trump was hardly the first to abjure the notion that the chief executive was in any way constrained, but he was perhaps the most flamboyant occupant of the Oval Office at flouting this norm—the weeks he spent cultivating and then inciting an attack on the Capitol being the ne plus ultra of his misrule.A lack of accountability since then . Three years on from the January 6 insurrection, but before the primary elections have even begun, Republican lawmakers are already . I suppose the silver lining here is that there won’t be much violence a year from now—there’s no need to ransack a Capitol whose occupants have provided for its pillage in advance. This week, however, Trump’s lawyers upped the stakes considerably, contending that the president  for ordering SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political opponent, unless he was swiftly impeached by Congress and convicted for the crime in the Senate first. That’s cold comfort to Trump’s murdered rival, to say nothing of any impeachment-minded lawmakers, who in this infernal thought exercise would obviously be the next under the gun of Trump’s mercenaries.We are, however, not completely unarmed against Trump’s thuggery: Article 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment , disqualifying anyone who played a part in inciting an insurrection from holding office again. Unfortunately, while it is rare for the Supreme Court to disarm anyone, it will, in all likelihood, deny the American people this protection. But the Roberts court has been vastly aided and abetted by our political media, who after waiting so long for Trump to discover virtue, have quickly declared the Article 3 tool to be a vice—either searingly unfair to use in this instance or invalid on its face. When the decision eventually comes, the press will have created an environment in which the Supreme Court’s disregard for the Constitution’s text won’t be viewed as a radical act.That this consensus was reached so quickly is something of a surprise, as the dominant mode of the pundit class is to venerate the Constitution as a peerless document, the final answer to all questions. As The New Republic’s Osita Nwanevu has written, . But the media has gone to strange lengths to specifically discount this one part of the Constitution that was designed to prevent the crisis we now face. An indelible example of this rough treatment  on December 28, the day that Maine’s secretary of state decided that a plain reading of Article 3 compelled her to remove Trump from her state’s ballot. The Times could not let the matter pass without injecting opinion into what purported to be a straight news story, referring to Article 3 in derogatory terms: “an obscure clause of a constitutional amendment enacted after the Civil War.” The Fourteenth Amendment, in toto, is about 400 words long. There are no “obscure” parts to it—no small-print footnotes stuffed away in the back pages or lost-to-memory secret lore that requires Nicolas Cage’s help to unearth.Those who’ve been more up front about their opinion-mongering haven’t been any less meretricious in their treatment of Article 3. Writing for his newsletter, Indignity, Tom Scocca  of those who’ve recently endeavored to “pretend” that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn’t say what it says, from the “” from pundits to the “” of legal experts doing business as Constitution doubters. One example that stands out for its sheer mendacity comes from Yale Law professor (and it’s almost always a Yale Law professor) Jed Rubenfeld, who  for The Wall Street Journal’s opinion section, admonishing those who might wield it to save the country from harm that while the “Colorado Supreme Court didn’t exactly get the law wrong” when it plucked Trump from its ballot, the “problem” was “there was no law to get right,” on account of the fact that “almost no case law exists on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.” Indeed, one of the big reasons that there’s precious little case law on that particular part of the Fourteenth Amendment is that it’s hitherto proven to be such an adequate bulwark against a president ordering an insurrection that hardly any presidents have tried it. It’s generally pretty hard to generate case law when everyone agrees not to break a law. But Rubenfeld’s reprimands ring pretty hollow if we must, at the first instance of this law being broken, concede that the plain text of the Constitution is invalid.The most idiotic case against the Fourteenth Amendment solution is    : the idea that the people, and not judges, must decide Trump’s fate. As Kurt Lash recently scolded from the New York Times opinion page, this battle for the Republic : “Let the people make their own decision about Donald Trump.” But where did Article 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment come from, if not “the people?” These words were ratified through the same democratic process as every other amendment to the Constitution. They weren’t put there by gods or monsters. Moreover, as The New Republic contributor Andrew Koppelman , “The people” have, on two occasions now, unambiguously rejected Trump. In 2016, their decision was thwarted by the Electoral College; in 2020, Trump reacted to his Electoral College loss by trying to overthrow its decision through the corrupt means that this Constitutional amendment was specifically written to prevent. How many times do “the people” have to render a decision before they’re allowed to use the Constitution to enforce it?There is every possibility that, this November, the American people will, for a third consecutive time, do exactly what Lash demands and again decide that Trump is unfit to rule. It will be well within the realm of possibility that the popular vote will once again be overruled by the Electoral College—or there may simply be enough Republicans on hand to deny the American people the right to the decision they’ve rendered. How will those chiding the effort to forestall this fate through lawful means account for themselves, should this come to pass? What is it about the broken America they’re helping to usher in through their empty, repetitive screeds that they find so appealing? Are the clicks really that good? This article first appeared in Power Mad, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Jason Linkins. .</p>

    <h1>John Fetterman Speaks: I Haven’t Changed a Lick</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 23:09:29 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> All life evolves, even that of U.S. senators. John Fetterman is no exception, even if the junior senator from Pennsylvania insists he hasn’t changed a lick. “I’m not a progressive, I’m just a Democrat,” Fetterman said during an exclusive interview with The New Republic on Wednesday.Some might beg to differ. In the past, he , “My dude, I’m a progressive Democrat.” He backed Bernie Sanders enthusiastically in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, saying of Sanders, “We stand together as the most progressive candidates in our respective races.” Many progressives expressed excitement in 2022 after he beat a more establishment-friendly Democrat in the primary and then flipped a Senate seat that Republicans had long held—even after suffering a near-fatal stroke a few months before.But in recent months, that enthusiasm has given way to frustration and even anger from the left because of his outspoken support for Israel amid its overwhelming assault on Gaza after Hamas killed 1,200 people on October 7. He earned even more ire when he called for more restrictions on immigration as Republicans hope to close off people’s means to enter the United States legally in exchange for funding for Ukraine. And on Thursday, in a speech to a Jewish organization, he referenced charges of white genocide against South Africa, which has brought genocide charges against Israel before the International Court of Justice at The Hague, by  that “maybe South Africa maybe ought to sit this one out when it comes to criticizing the behavior of other nations.”  Fetterman later clarified his remarks Friday in a  to The Independent. “The entirety of my point was this: South Africa should instead focus on the spiraling humanitarian crises on its own continent—like Sudan, where more than 7 million people have been displaced with widespread atrocities,” he said.Fetterman’s policy positions make some of his campaign supporters feel like he pulled a bait and switch. “As soon as he gets money from AIPAC, what does he do? He switches and says he’s never been a progressive,” said Tiana, one of a half-dozen protesters gathered outside Fetterman’s Senate office Monday.Fetterman has received $244,100 from pro-Israel groups, but AIPAC has not contributed to the senator’s election campaigns, according to a review of OpenSecrets data from the last four years.Tiana said she traveled from Washington, D.C., to volunteer for Fetterman’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania but has since left the Democratic Party over President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. Fetterman bristles at the notion that he’s somehow sold out progressives, insisting instead that he is the same person. “I vote on bedrock Democratic principles, and I’m not gonna leave my party,” Fetterman said.Still, his recent pronouncements on Israel and the border have been surprising, to say the least. On Wednesday, The New Republic sat down with the senator for an exclusive interview about the evolution that he says has not occurred. He still uses the smartphone that he has used since suffering a stroke two years ago that dictates his speech and displays his words across a screen. In our interview, he pulled a phone from the right-side pocket of his black polyester gym shorts, opened a dictation app, and nodded for me to start speaking. Text of my speech cascaded down Fetterman’s screen in awkward stop-and-go intervals.You … said you will never sell … out the Dreamers. Is relief for Dreamers … a condition of your support … for a potential border deal?“I did say that,” Fetterman replied to the first part of the question. “Of course.…” There was a pause, and then he replied to the second part. “I can’t and would never vote against their interests,” said Fetterman of Dreamers. “How can we penalize children who were brought here and now are living their best lives? They’re making incredible contributions, and I’m married to one of them.” Gisele Barreto’s family emigrated illegally from Brazil when she was a 7-year-old, landing in New York City, where she grew up poor. In 2004, Barreto got her green card. She became a citizen five years later, shortly after marrying Fetterman, then the mayor of his hometown of Braddock, Pennsylvania. If he was trying to sound conciliatory on immigration, he was unapologetic on Israel. Asked if the Senate should put conditions on U.S. military aid to Israel, Fetterman didn’t waffle. “No, none,” he said. Images of the remaining Hamas hostages taken on October 7 hang along a wall in the front office of his Senate suite. On the wall opposite are images of Hamas hostages released. A steady stream of cease-fire advocates visit Fetterman’s office each day to demand that he do better. Staffers log their concerns and, in lieu of offering their agreement, instead give them tiny bottles of cold water from a mini-fridge on the floor and candy made in Hershey and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. “Standing with Israel and thinking that we should have a secure border, I don’t know why either one of them is controversial,” said Fetterman, who has indicated that he would support a bipartisan proposal backed by the White House to permanently restrict legal immigration to unlock Republican support in the Senate for Ukrainian military funding. “Ukraine is my priority—and Israel,” Fetterman told me back in December, a foreign policy position from which he has not budged. This much has to be admitted, though. As upset as his old progressive allies may be, his stances aren’t hurting him at home. In fact, the opposite is true. A Quinnipiac  of 600 Pennsylvania voters published January 10 showed that 26 percent of those surveyed said Fetterman’s support for Israel’s military offensive in Palestine improved their view of him, while only 14 percent said it made them see him more negatively (over half said it had no impact on their view). On immigration, the numbers were even more starkly in his favor, as 35 percent said his new harder line improved their view of him and just 9 percent said it made them think less favorably of him. Pennsylvania is a swing state, up for grabs by either party in November’s election. It has a significant Jewish population and a very popular Jewish governor in Josh Shapiro. But unlike Shapiro and Casey, who enjoy high approval numbers, Fetterman has struggled to get his own approval above 50 percent. The Quinnipiac poll had him at 45 percent.But was Fetterman really as progressive as his detractors on the left now claim? As lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania in 2022, Fetterman  against lifting Title 42, the controversial pandemic-era authority that allowed federal agents to expel migrants from the country as public health threats. That same year, Fetterman  Jewish Insider that he’s “not really a progressive” on the issue of Israel. “Our campaign is based on core Democratic values and principles, and always has been, and there is no daylight between myself and these kinds of unwavering commitments to Israel’s security,” he said.Democratic activist Brett Goldman noted at the time that Fetterman had “never come out and said that he’s not a supporter of Israel,” despite the public perception that Fetterman would eventually align with progressives if elected to the Senate. “That may not be true, but that’s what the perception is,”  Goldman, a remark that presaged the progressive disillusionment with Fetterman today.“Last question,” I said. “OK, fine,” he replied, nodding his consent, then fixing his unblinking eyes on his smartphone screen. Speaking slowly, I watched my question cascade down his screen, not all at once, but again in broken intervals.Beyond … border security what … specifically is your ideal migrant policy package … relating to migrant rights? Or even just at a … high level?Fetterman paused for a five-count, staring up the East Grand Stairs of the Senate, giving me a hard side-eye, before taking a deep breath and speaking in a slow, careful cadence. “Look,” he said, “ideally we honor where America has historically been with immigration. Ideally we would protect Dreamers and give them a franchise. They need to be citizens.” Excitedly I pointed back at his phone for a follow-up.  “Then … what is your message … for your Republican colleagues who see … no distinction between …?”Fetterman stopped reading, slid his phone into the kangaroo pouch of his black cotton hoodie. “I’ve been told that they’re not going to be put in harm’s way, but if the border talks did put them in harm’s way, I can never and would never vote against their interest,” he said.   “To be clear,” he continued. “I’m not calling for deporting hundreds of thousands or millions of people, or that kind of thing. That’s not who we are. We have to secure our border, but I want every immigrant to have their own American dream. OK?” “Got it,” I exhaled loudly, realizing only then I’d been holding my breath, hanging on his every syllable. “Thank you, Senator.” Fetterman offered me an awkward handshake before abruptly shuffling away toward the entrance of the Senate chamber. “Yeah, thanks,” he muttered as he walked by me. This was new. Fetterman had finally declared his alignment with promises Gisele made to migrant communities (and Latino press) on the campaign trail, that her husband John would fight for them. “I know what it’s like to live in limbo,” Gisele  while John recovered from his stroke in September 2022. “John has seen my journey, my family’s journey as immigrants to this country.”All senators evolve, even John Fetterman, but has he actually moved rightward on Israel and border security? Or is this who he was all along, just no one bothered to ask for the details? Fetterman arrived in the Senate with a reputation for being a straight shooter, a no-bullshit small-town guy from a steel town with a foul mouth, a migrant wife, a closet full of gym clothes. Has Fetterman sold out the progressive supporters who elected him? Or did his supporters simply ignore the early warning signs that Fetterman was never going to join the Squad when he got to the Senate? Both can be true, but the evidence suggests that Fetterman’s positions on Israel and border security have been consistent all along, he’s just finally being asked to articulate them.The bad news for Fetterman’s haters is that now they’re stuck with him for another five years. Meanwhile, the junior senator from Pennsylvania now has the rest of his freshman term in the Senate to navigate the tricky path of “evolving” without being seen as betraying core values that got him elected in the first place.</p>

    <h1>Kansas Legislators to Kansas Voters: You Spoke Loud and Clear, and We Don’t Care</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 23:04:25 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Republican lawmakers in  want to make sure you know they don’t care about the will of the voters. State representatives have introduced a bill completely banning abortion, despite Kansans  less than two years ago to keep protections for the procedure in the state constitution.House Bill 2492 was  Wednesday by eight Republican state representatives, seven of whom are men. The measure would ban all abortions except those necessary to save the patient’s life. The bill  prescribing, distributing, selling, or donating abortion medication. Anyone who helps someone get an abortion could face civil proceedings, while doctors who perform abortions would face a minimum fine of $10,000 per procedure.The measure flies directly in the face of the will of the voters, as noted by Amber Sellers, the advocacy director of Trust Women, a pro-abortion nonprofit in Wichita, Kansas. “Kansans spoke—loudly—on the issue,” Sellers told the Kansas Reflector. “It’s time for anti-abortion lawmakers to wake up, remember and finally listen to the message that voters continue to send.”In August 2022, less than two months after the Supreme Court overturned , Kansans  to keep language in the state constitution protecting the right to abortion. The vote proved to be a bellwether, with multiple states voting to increase abortion protections since.But that didn’t stop Kansas Republican lawmakers from trying to circumvent the will of the people. The Sunflower State GOP has tried to pass a bill that would let  of individual towns and cities ban abortion, as well as a bill that would force doctors to  about abortion medication. Both measures were ultimately unsuccessful.And just as the Kansas vote turned out to be an indicator of what voters wanted nationwide, so too have Republicans in other states followed the Kansas GOP’s model. Most recently, Ohio residents  in November to enshrine abortion protections in the state constitution. Ohio Republican lawmakers immediately set about finding ways to enact legislation that would  the results.If the Kansas bill passes the state legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, it will likely be vetoed by Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. The GOP does have a large enough majority to override Kelly’s veto, but the abortion ban is unlikely to survive a legal challenge. The state Supreme Court  in 2019 that the Kansas constitution protects abortion rights, meaning the bill violates those rights.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A New York state judge on Friday  Donald Trump to pay The New York Times almost $400,000 in legal fees for a lawsuit he brought against the paper in 2021.Trump accused the paper and three Times reporters of conspiring with his niece Mary Trump, who has contributed to The New Republic, in an “insidious plot” to illicitly obtain his tax records. The Times published a  on Trump’s taxes in 2018 that revealed the president wasn’t the self-made billionaire he claimed he was. In fact, most of his wealth came from his parents or from dodging taxes, as his businesses continued to bleed money elsewhere.State Supreme Court Justice Robert Reed  Trump’s case in May, writing in his ruling that Trump’s claims “fail as a matter of constitutional law.”Reed issued another  on Friday ordering Trump to pay the paper and the reporters Susanne Craig, David Barstow, and Russ Buettner a total of $392,638.69 in legal fees.This just happened: A New York State judge has ordered Donald Trump to pay The New York Times $392,638.69 for legal fees connected to a frivolous lawsuit he brought against the paper, two of my colleagues and me.👍— Susanne Craig (@susannecraig) Trump made waves by refusing to release his tax returns when he first ran for president in 2016, which is not required but is precedent. He then actually brought more attention to his taxes by continually refusing to release the documents to the public or at the very least to Congress.The House Ways and Means Committee finally obtained six years’ worth of the former president’s  in late November 2022. After first reviewing the documents behind closed doors, the committee released Trump’s tax returns. The documents  Trump listed large charitable donations, millions of dollars in goods sold, and massive financial losses each year to avoid paying taxes.</p>

    <h1>Trump Must Return Millions He Got From Foreign Governments, Democrats Say</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 17:46:59 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Representative Jamie Raskin demanded Friday that Donald Trump return the nearly $8 million he was paid by foreign governments while he was president.A  released last week by House Oversight Committee Democrats found that Trump made more than $7.8 million during his first two years in office. He did not ask Congress for permission to keep the money, as is required by the Constitution.“I write today to demand that you immediately return to the American people the $7,886,072 that we know you have accepted from foreign governments,” Raskin said in a  to Trump. The Maryland Democrat noted that the report findings were likely incomplete, as it covers just half of Trump’s presidency and transactions at just four of his more than 500 businesses.“I also demand that you give Congress a full accounting of the money, benefits and other emoluments ‘of any kind whatever’ you pocketed from foreign governments or their agents during your term as President and that you return the total sum of these foreign emoluments,” Raskin said in his letter.“Your acceptance of foreign emoluments while in office was a stunning violation of the U.S. Constitution—and a profound betrayal of the interests of the United States and the trust of the American people.”The money came from some of the “world’s most unsavory regimes,” according to the report, and Trump never asked for congressional approval to keep the funds, as mandated by the Constitution. The countries included China—which gave Trump $5.5 million, the largest sum listed in the report—Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Hungary.Trump isn’t even trying to hide the fact that he received payments from foreign governments. In a Fox News town hall Wednesday night, Trump  the amount as “a small amount of money.”He then justified the fact that he received foreign payments by arguing he was “doing services for them.”“People were staying in these massive hotels, these beautiful hotels,” Trump said. “I don’t get $8 million for doing nothing.”</p>

    <h1>Here’s Who Qualifies for the New Student Loan Forgiveness Plan</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:46:40 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Joe Biden  Friday that federal student debt will be wiped out for millions of people, despite previous conservative attempts to stop him.The Biden administration unveiled the  in August. The SAVE plan reduces millions of borrowers’ monthly payments based on their income and family size. The plan also caps interest accrual and forgives remaining balances after a certain number of years.The new round of student loan forgiveness under the SAVE plan applies to borrowers who took out less than $12,000 in federal loans and have been paying off their balances for at least 10 years. They will have their remaining debt canceled in February.This move, which comes nearly six months ahead of schedule, “will particularly help community college borrowers, low-income borrowers, and those struggling to repay their loans,” Biden said in a .About 30 million people are eligible for the SAVE plan, but Biden said in his statement that just 6.9 million are currently enrolled. He did not give details on how many borrowers will see immediate benefits from the upcoming cancellations.Biden has repeatedly pushed for increased student debt cancellation, despite pushback from conservatives. But the president has refused to give up: In July, his administration  it was forgiving $39 billion in student debt.The Biden administration counted payments for borrowers who had made partial or late payments, and for people who had paused their payments under certain circumstances, for instance if they were a student or unemployed, but continued to pay the interest. These types of payments previously went uncounted, according to the government.Biden had originally proposed a plan to cancel up to $20,000 of student debt for up to 43 million people. But the ultraconservative Supreme Court  6–3 against his plan in June.</p>

    <h1>Can Nikki Haley Ride Iowa’s Midwinter Madness to the Nomination?</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:08:51 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> As if Donald Trump’s big-league lead in the polls wasn’t enough of a reason to stop paying attention to Iowa and its first-in-the-nation caucus now, anyone unfortunate enough to still be paying attention was treated to this week’s undercard debate between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. The sniping, stammering, and eye-rolling was all kids’ table stuff, without even the whinging smarm of Vivek Ramaswamy as Ted Cruz’s tech-bro younger brother.But there is no “adults’ table” in the modern GOP. It’s chaos and pouting, all the time. Trump staged a town hall on Fox News to run opposite the debate intentionally but anyone who took the time to compare the two events would have been at a loss to determine who was “unpresidential” and who was “presidential.” The choice was just between obviously and not-so-obviously unhinged.But I drove around Iowa for many days recently, and the conventional wisdom about the 2024 Republican field is wrong. Trump is not inevitable. And Nikki Haley is the most dangerous candidate the GOP has produced in a decade. She is also the most capable of beating Joe Biden.Iowans greet reporters covering the caucuses with the wary Midwestern friendliness that, in Minnesota, they call “neighborly right up until the front door.” Over the years, I’ve found potential caucusgoers happy to discuss their political thinking but often reluctant to forthrightly declare their allegiances. Those not familiar with the culture of the caucuses—or who harbor stereotypes of simplistic rural conservatism—might be surprised by the Sunday morning talk show–ready punditry exhibited by men with farming-brand gimme caps and women with multiple pieces of cross-adorned jewelry, who can hold forth on electability and strategy with the best of talking heads. Unlike most cable newsers, they tend to refer to the challengers by their first names—an artifact of having the hopefuls tromp through living rooms and county halls so regularly. “I think if you look at Ron’s record in Florida, he’s got the appeal to get the Trump votes,” one gentleman told me. Another: “Nikki can get the suburban women Trump can’t.” (Not sure if it’s reverence that keeps Trump from being “Donald” or just the sense that “Trump”—that plosive “p”!—has always suited him better than his first name.)Their caution is due to more than charming prairie stoicism. Politically active Iowans of both parties are historically protective of their position as First in the Nation and enjoy playing out the suspense of what will go down on caucus night. With the disastrously glitchy accounting of 2016 having scared the Democrats into rethinking Iowa’s sacred position in their selection process, Republican voters seem to be playing their cards even closer to the vest and squeezing out any drama they can from what appears to outsiders like a contest so sloppily one-sided it’s barely worth monitoring: After all, Trump has a 49-point lead over his nearest competitors’ polling averages; 53 points in the .But speaking to actual Iowa caucusgoers reminds you of a variable unique to the Hawkeye State: Iowans are cagey about their votes because they are really, truly not sure what they will do.The caucus format encourages not just last-minute decisions but after-the-last-minute conversions: Neighbors  to listen to each other make speeches on behalf of their nominee, and the appeals are not necessarily tethered to policy or even an official campaign statement. The system combines the worst aspects of an election to the high school homecoming court with the dark-money machinations of American national politics. It is more like homecoming, actually, because many of the caucuses occur in the same places as high school dances. You can be charmed by the process’s lack of professionalism even as you are appalled by how fundamentally undemocratic it is. At a caucus in 2020, a volunteer handed me a fun-size candy bar stapled to a flyer:  Yet it is the wild, hyperlocal horse-trading, unpredictable circumstances, and literal sugar high of the caucuses that could defeat the Republican candidate least interested in democracy—or at least the one most vocal about his disinterest. Though much of the national media has been more focused on the various court cases threatening to keep Trump from participating in the 2024 election, he could still be sidelined the old-fashioned way: Not enough people vote for him.At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work this year. The Democrats have done away with some of the truly batty caucus procedures—for the first time, there will be secret ballots! And they won’t make people physically gather into cliques representing candidate support. But the caucuses are still misshapen beasts, prone to unpredictable behavior: They are a multihour commitment in the dead of winter, in which neighbors try to convince neighbors to swap their vote.Let’s recall the absurdities that emerge from the caucuses. Since 2004, there have been seven contests in Iowa: Democrats in 2004, 2008, 2016, and 2020; Republicans also in 2008 and 2016 and on their own in 2012. In every case, the final results looked vastly different than the polling suggested—either because of an upset or a landslide emerging out of a tangled polling clump. You might recall the biggest shocks: Obama leaping from a dead heat with Clinton to . Santorum surprising himself by to beat Romney. Cruz  behind to four points ahead of Trump—and little Marco coming in second!But even when the results match expectations, a close read of the results tells the story of a process and a populace that confounds expectations more than it meets them. In 2004, John Kerry, Howard Dean, John Edwards, and Dick Gephardt started the morning of the caucuses in a statistical dead heat; by , Kerry had collected 13 more points, Edwards 11, with Dean falling by a few and Gephardt by seven. This year’s particular variables are familiar but threaten to destabilize the rickety framework of the caucuses: A wave of bitter cold and winter storms is currently sweeping the state. These have interrupted campaigning already; forecasts in Iowa’s three population centers are at least three or four degrees below zero. In some of the more rural counties—which, OK, means most of Iowa—the forecast goes as low as negative 14. These will be the . The massive lead Trump has is its own burden. Even a man as eager to believe in his own popularity as Trump has managed to grok that his apparent inevitability could break him. To turn his supporters out, Trump must insist he could lose, though it wounds him to say so. “Pretend you’re one point down,” he urged them this week. He has also said the situation is dire enough that he —“We’d love to have you fill out the card; I’ll caucus with you”—so much for caring about voter fraud. A close examination of the polls reveals another vein of instability in Trump’s lead: An unusual number of Iowans have admitted they are undecided or might switch their support; a late- found that a full third of respondents said they could change their minds. For comparison sake, 2016 polls  that 86 percent of respondents were either completely decided or “strongly committed.” Only 16 percent of Trump voters express uncertainty; around 40 percent of Haley and DeSantis supporters confess such squishiness. But given the mutable alliances of caucus night, dropped support for DeSantis or Haley doesn’t necessarily work to Trump’s benefit. At this point, anyone supporting his rivals is doing so as an explicit rebuke of Trump as the nominee, if not Trump himself. I talked to several voters who voted for Trump twice and appreciated his presidency. Over and over, they echoed what Haley and DeSantis have said from the stump: Either he’s a distraction, or he’s distracted, or both. The question Trump skeptics will ask themselves on caucus night is probably not, “Can I live without Trump at the top of the ticket?” but, “Who do I think can beat Biden?”I don’t think it’s Ron DeSantis.I would prefer people decide who to support based on their position on issues and not their electability. I also think DeSantis is a disingenuous hate goblin with an ideology born of utter convenience. So it gives me no pleasure to report that the DeSantis supporters that turned out for his events are picking their candidate based on his positions. His Trumpy positions.I hate to make fun of people for their looks or just way of being, but, again, speaking as an outsider, DeSantis moves through the world with oblivious awkwardness. He has the affect of an animatronic bear. Maybe that’s why he hates Disney so much. A lot has been made of the  that he wears lifts to appear taller, but I don’t think we should shame people for dressing in a way that supports their gender identity. But none of the people supporting him care much about the strangeness of his smile or weird way of standing. They cheer him because he has more finely tuned his speech to the dog whistles that excite the Trumpist base. He’s big on “woke mind virus”–style fearmongering. Disney is “trans-ing kids”; there’s porn in the schools! Also, he shipped a bunch of “illegals” to Martha’s Vineyard. All of this hits exactly where it is expected among his fans. But listening to him as a visitor from planet general election, he can sound like he’s running a very obscure RPG. There’s some mystical power called “DEI”? A villain named “Soros”? DeSantis  to be “the worst nightmare for the medical biosecurity machine” sounds like he’s playing something from the Alien franchise, not running for president.I’m not sure he believes what he’s saying, but one lesson he’s taken from Trump is that you don’t have to believe in anything as long as you’re willing to go to war against vulnerable people. DeSantis has all of Trump’s nihilism—but is even less honest about it. He presents himself as a moral crusader. He’s less interested in morality than power. Elected by a thin margin in 2018, his first year as Florida governor—including his initial reaction to Covid— him to be center-rightish and willing to work with Democrats. Then he started his working on his résumé for the presidential campaign. The media continually misreads his “decisive” Florida victory in 2022; he won by a lot because he cheated a lot, instituting various hurdles to voting that suppressed turnout among  and . It didn’t help that the Democrats were running a re-retreaded Charlie Crist—well dressed but grey all over; a human gym sock. Watching DeSantis is depressing. He is Trump minus the indictment and a few inches up and around. I sometimes wonder if he’s jealous of Trump’s mug shot. The only good news about DeSantis is that if he finishes third (as current polling indicates), he will also have no money left. As the saying goes, there are only two tickets out of Iowa—up or out.The bad news about DeSantis is that Haley is a surging second in New Hampshire and she is worse news for Democrats, and maybe America, than him. Haley could beat Biden. The polls already tell us so;  from The Wall Street Journal, she bests the president by 17 while Trump and DeSantis squeak by, almost within the margin of error, by four points. She is a frighteningly talented campaigner in person. Like most politicians on the stump, she sticks to a set speech at every event. What makes her special is how she manages to illuminate it with conviction. She possesses an improvisatory spark, sure-footedly swerving off topic with a wink and nod, as if to admit, “See, we all know I’m giving a speech, but I’m also here with you, listening to myself give a speech.”After an audience member sneezed at one event, she interrupted her patter with a “Bless you” that telegraphed empathy and conviction: “I can care about you and still take care of business.” I was impressed; I was even more impressed when the exact same thing happened four hours later at a different campaign event. I can’t say if the sneezers were planted—at this point in the campaign season, it’s a little late for allergies—but more power to her if they were. If Haley is going to win Iowa—or even come in a strong second—it will be primarily because she and her team have put that level of detail work into making every spontaneous (or was it????) audience sneeze worth something. Such moments demonstrate the strengths of Haley’s superficially traditional campaign. With a little extra shove against the weight of disbelief, her events allow one to imagine that the past eight years have been free of Trump’s reality-warping presence. She doesn’t mine Fox for easy outrage material, and I don’t think I’ve heard her say “woke” once. She speaks passionately but without venom; it’s not that she doesn’t call for bloodshed; she just directs her fire against targets invoked by politicians of all stripes (look out Hamas, terrorists, and cartel members). This passive-voice violence may not be as satisfying as Trump going full Nazi (immigrants “poisoning the blood of our nation” and all); 50 percent of Iowa Republicans  they like Trump more now! But does liking him translate to believing he can win?  Every aspect of Haley’s campaign sets her apart from Trump and DeSantis. Suppose you didn’t listen to what her actual policies were. You might come away believing that she was set to personally repair every behavioral norm broken over Trump’s fleshy thigh during the past eight years. This is what she wants event attendees to hear, and it is what the people I talked to heard. The Iowans focused on the general are turning out for Haley, which should terrify us all.Watching her work the rooms during the day I spent with her in Iowa, I understood how her dark-horse run for governor slingshotted her from backbench legislator to “face of the New South.” At the time, you may recall, the Republican Party was rebranding as a haven for “mama grizzlies,” Haley was shoehorned in among more flashy personalities such as Sarah Palin and Christine O’Donnell. Her style was always too soft-spoken to fit comfortably into the Tea Party patois of the time. But unlike most of that crowd, she never faded from view. It’s a testament to her skills as an administrator and her devotion to the conservative policy that that she stayed in the front ranks of the party even as Palin and O’Donnell have shuffled off into shabby notoriety. But her political agenda was never significantly different from that of the far far right, and it still isn’t. DeSantis has tried to frame her as insufficiently devoted to terrorizing trans people, pregnant people, and immigrants. And it’s true that she doesn’t sound like someone reposting Libs of TikTok memes.However, the difference between howling about “trans-ing kids” and  “boys in girls’ sports the women’s issue of our time,” as Haley puts it, is entirely semantic. Both of these phrases betray a bedrock belief that trans people should not exist. She  we shouldn’t call undocumented immigrants “criminals,” but, just like Trump and DeSantis, does  all 11 million of them that now call the United States home. I’ve  about her insincere mewling for “” regarding the “abortion debate” before. My own view is that she can fuck off with her compassion; we need abortions. But The New York Times and Ron DeSantis have confused her honey-glazed rhetoric with moderation. In so doing, they make her general election argument for her.Her foreign policy positions resemble something that neocons and neoliberals would recognize. Does that make her a “moderate”? More to the point, are her foreign policy positions the thing that will make or break her in Iowa? She’s gotten to second place without backing away from them.As Trump and DeSantis frame it, Haley’s sin is that she is a reminder of what normal politics looks like. But the fact that she is only a reminder and not literally poised to part from the nihilist policy brutalism of the modern GOP is her strength. She’s a Trumpian wolf clad in sheep’s vibes, and she’s pulling the wool over the eyes of all the right people. In this week’s debate, DeSantis squawked about the trending topics that fire the sick imaginations of the stochastic terrorists swarming over X, a.k.a. Twitter. At the same time, Haley talked like a politician, rattling his mechanics with repeated references to . She reminded the audience that his super PAC has put $150 million into the race and just gotten lower and lower poll numbers. The hate-seeking bear opened his mouth to respond and closed it without speaking; are the animatronics finally breaking down?I’ve been covering Iowa for two decades now. It has always been long drives in straight lines followed by Caesar salads in chain hotels. Despite the reliable rhythm of it all, the caucuses have constantly surprised everyone, including me. Iowa looks flat, but it is sharp. There’s no caucus result that should comfort people who care about continuing to correct this country’s curve into despotism. The best-case scenario is that DeSantis’s enormous investment pays off (and he truly has sunk the ducats into this effort; I went to a postdebate buffet, and there were petit fours and specialty meats!). That way, we end up with months of Donald and Ron—two squabbling man-bear-pigs turning off general election voters over and over again.The status quo—Trump shuffles off with a huge win—is medium frightening but in a familiar way. If the matchup between Trump and Biden solidifies this early, Democratic complacency is the biggest enemy.The worst-case scenario is that Haley’s sleek self-presentation and the unwitting collaboration of her opponents lift her into second place in Iowa and a win in New Hampshire (). After that, well, the GOP gets a chance to decide if it is so dedicated to patriarchy and white supremacy it would rather lose the presidency than put a woman of color on the ticket. Perhaps not even as president; she has refused to say she wouldn’t be Trump’s V.P. If the Republican base is willing to shelve their prejudices just long enough to nominate her, they will get the regime of utter intolerance they want in the end.</p>

    <h1>Biden’s Airstrikes on Yemen Draw Outrage From Democrats and Republicans Alike</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:43:38 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Members of Congress are expressing their displeasure with  for launching airstrikes in Yemen, a move that has achieved the rare effect of uniting many Republicans and Democrats.The United States and the U.K.  16 different sites in Yemen Thursday night, hitting more than 60 targets, in a retaliatory strike against the Houthis. The strikes were meant to  the Houthis to stop blocking commercial ships in the Red Sea, a campaign it began over growing frustration with Israel’s war on Gaza.Members of Congress across the political spectrum expressed frustration late into the night that Biden gave them just a few hours’ notice before authorizing the strikes. Democratic Representative  was one of the first to state his outrage, writing on X (formerly Twitter) that presidents do not have unilateral authority to launch military strikes unless the country is under attack.The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict. That is Article I of the Constitution. I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.— Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) Khanna also retweeted former Republican Representative , who explained that the  only allows the president to involve the U.S. military in overseas hostilities if the country is already at war or is currently under attack, or if the president got special approval. Otherwise, Congress must be notified 48 hours in advance.Republican Representatives , , and , as well as Senator , were quick to back Khanna up on his point. All four Republicans stressed that Congress should have been given more advance notice.Ro is absolutely correct on this. — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) Representative  slammed Biden for authorizing the airstrike without congressional approval, though she also slammed him for multiple other issues. The Georgia Republican accused him of becoming a warmonger by supporting conflict in Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and now the Middle East.Democratic Representative , the only Palestinian American in Congress, accused Biden of violating the Constitution. “The American people are tired of endless war,” she wrote on X.. is violating Article I of the Constitution by carrying out airstrikes in Yemen without congressional approval. The American people are tired of endless war.— Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (@RepRashida) In a shocking display of unity, Massie  in the comments against people arguing on Biden’s behalf.Democratic Representatives  and  warned against involving the U.S. in more “endless wars,” alongside expressing their displeasure that Biden hadn’t notified Congress 48 hours in advance. Representative Pramila Jayapal  it “an “unacceptable violation of the Constitution.”Representatives  and Barbara Lee, both California Democrats, were worried that the airstrikes could escalate into something much greater. This is why I called for a ceasefire early. This is why I voted against war in Iraq. Violence only begets more violence. We need a ceasefire now to prevent deadly, costly, catastrophic escalation of violence in the region. — Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) Many other lawmakers, again both Democrats and Republicans, also made an unlikely alliance in backing Biden’s decision to order the airstrikes. House Speaker  and Senate Minority Leader  called the bombing “overdue.” Democratic Representatives  and  praised Biden for standing up to “terrorism” overseas.</p>

    <h1>Why the Media Narrative on Donald Trump’s Legal Woes Is Wrong</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:25:59 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Sometime this month, New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron will decide how much Donald Trump should pay in penalties in the fraud case brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Engoron has already ruled that Trump did commit fraud, so now it’s just a matter of the money. Engoron has been decidedly unimpressed by Trump’s lawyers’ arguments throughout the proceeding, so it seems reasonable to think Engoron will come close to, match, or maybe even exceed James’s request of $370 million.According to Lisa Rubin of MSNBC, speaking on Morning Joe Friday morning, the very theatricality of Trump and his attorneys’ denials can be a factor in the judge’s determination—that is, if Engoron determines that Trump and his lawyers’ lies are egregiously flamboyant and obvious, that can help dictate the penalty amount. Rubin predicted that the amount would be “in the hundreds of millions” of dollars and that perhaps Engoron would drop the nuclear penalty on Trump and his family—barring them from doing business in New York again.Meanwhile, as Engoron is deliberating, another trial is about to begin. The E. Jean Carroll defamation trial will open next Tuesday, the day after the Iowa caucuses. Last year, a jury found that Trump had lied about not sexually abusing Carroll years ago, and awarded her $5 million. Trump appealed. Last summer, , amid intense media debate and speculation, that Trump did in fact “rape” Carroll. Meanwhile, on the political front, Trump will win Monday’s Iowa caucuses. The following Tuesday, January 23, New Hampshirites will go to the polls. One poll that got a ton of attention showed Nikki Haley within seven points of Trump. She has some momentum, but in , Trump still has a . And he’ll be coming off a massive win in Iowa. So let’s say for the moment that Trump wins New Hampshire handily too.The media narrative with respect to the Trump lawsuits will be what it has been, except on steroids: Trump’s legal woes only help him. That’s true with respect to Republican voters. But there are a lot of reasons to think that that piece of conventional wisdom will be dead wrong when it comes to other voters.First of all, New Hampshire may well prove this point. Independents can vote in New Hampshire primaries and have a history of being cranky and unpredictable. Now let’s assume that Trump doesn’t win the Granite State handily—he wins it narrowly or maybe even loses. If that happens, Haley will be succeeding on the strength of those independent voters. And that will constitute a big and important switch that’s worth paying attention to.In 2016,  of the electorate in the state’s GOP primary, and Trump cleaned up among them: He got 36 percent of the independent vote, while his closest competitor, John Kasich, got 18 percent.If Trump loses independents in New Hampshire to Haley—even if he still wins overall—that will be a big sign that the Trump show isn’t playing well beyond the MAGA base. We’d have to wait until the results to see what these voters say about why they didn’t vote for Trump. But it’s hardly a stretch to think that Trump’s legal problems have to be part of the story. The media aren’t paying attention to this at all. Case in point: Last week, there was a Washington Post/University of Maryland  that got a lot of attention. In its write-up, the Post highlighted the fact that three years after January 6, Republicans were if anything more loyal to Trump, not less. The rest of the media largely followed that lead, so the story of that poll became yet another “Trump can get away with anything” story.But other results from the poll that got a lot less attention told a different story. The survey asked people if the Justice Department, in charging Trump for insurrection, was holding him accountable as it would anyone else or was targeting him unfairly. A comfortable majority, 57 percent, said he was being treated fairly. That’s the exact percentage of independents who said the same, compared to 90 percent of Democrats and 20 percent of Republicans.In other words: The Republican base, as is so often the case in these kinds of polls, is a total outlier that distorts the overall results. What does this tell us? I think it’s clear. As the primary “drama” winds down, and as the courtroom drama heats up—and both of these are likely to happen in early March—we’ll see the trials start to take more of a toll on Trump. If the Jack Smith insurrection trial proceeds as originally planned on March 4 (that’s now in abeyance pending resolution of a Trump appeal), Trump’s remaining and mathematically meaningless primary wins are going to get a lot less attention than what’s going on in that Washington courtroom.Don’t buy the narrative that none of this hurts Trump. It will. He’s not being persecuted. He’s a scumbag who did lie about his property values, who did rape Carroll, who did lead an insurrection, who did take classified documents (he doesn’t dispute this—he just says he was allowed to do anything he pleased), and God knows what else. Republicans may not care. But I think real Americans do.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. .</p>

    <h1>Elise Stefanik’s Ugly “Hostages” Barb Points to Serious GOP Mayhem Ahead</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> GOP Representative Elise Stefanik no doubt thought it was shrewd to  the rioters who attacked the Capitol as “January 6 hostages.” This sort of talk hits a sweet trifecta for a GOP leader with seemingly limitless ambition. It reassures the right-wing media that the GOP leadership is fully behind Donald Trump. It fires up the MAGA base’s small-dollar donors. And it infuriates the libs, which excites the right-wing media and MAGA voters all over again.But it turns out vulnerable House Republicans aren’t too thrilled about Stefanik’s barb. The Washington Post  from it, a sign that being associated with pro-insurrection sentiments is politically dangerous in swing districts across the country.News flash, vulnerable Republicans: This will almost certainly get much worse. If you think some throwaway sound bite designed to pump up Sean Hannity creates political problems for you, what will it mean for you if Trump goes to trial this year or even earns a criminal conviction?Here’s an overlooked possibility to contemplate: While commentators often assume the prosecutions of Trump are only driving the GOP to unite behind Trump, it’s perfectly plausible that when his legal travails grow more serious, it will ensure that GOP divisions grow deeper—perhaps much deeper.Stefanik’s insurrectionist outburst suggests a misplaced confidence that none of this threatens the party. Last month, Trump  of the  charged or convicted in relation to January 6, “I don’t call them prisoners. I call them hostages.” Then  last Sunday, Stefanik brashly echoed his language: “I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages.”The way vulnerable Republicans  is telling. “They’re criminal defendants, not hostages,” said Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. “I don’t defend people who hit cops, who vandalized our Capitol,” added Nebraska’s Don Bacon, pointedly adding of the “hostage” language: “The broad, broad electorate doesn’t like it.”Given that Fitzpatrick and Bacon represent two of the 17 districts held by Republicans that Trump lost in 2020, that’s an indication of how politically outside the mainstream it is to deny the gravity of January 6 and smear the justice system’s response to it as illegitimate.The details of this year’s political and legal calendar suggest this dynamic could intensify. In coming days, an appeals court will  Trump’s demand that the criminal charges against him for conspiring to overthrow U.S. democracy be dismissed on grounds that his misconduct constituted official presidential duties. The Supreme Court could soon follow. While Trump’s strategy of delaying his trial might work, it’s more likely to fail.Now recall that last year, Trump  House Republicans to shut down the government to defund his prosecutions. They didn’t, but at the very least, the actuality of Trump’s trial unfolding before the nation will cause him to ramp up his entreaties into 2024. And it may well be harder for Republicans to resist them during a presidential election year.“It’s about to get real for House Republicans that Trump is going to criminal trial before the election,” legal scholar Matthew Seligman, who , told me. “That will put them under intense pressure to try to derail the prosecution.”What then? House Democratic aides see a range of possibilities, such as votes on resolutions declaring the prosecution of Trump corrupt, or possibly more hearings designed to harass and sabotage the case against him. Those aides point out that Trump could be locking up the GOP nomination (making it harder for vulnerable Republicans to resist closing ranks behind him) even as his trial gets underway (making support for Trump look more corrupt to swing voters).The sweet spot for many Republicans is to say that of course they condemn anything related to January 6 that was actually criminal, while also insisting that the legal system’s targeting of Trump is obviously politically motivated because, duh, a Democrat is president. That’s an easier posture to hold when Republicans can redirect the question of Trump’s guilt back on to the unpopular President Biden by insisting he’s surreptitiously pulling law enforcement’s strings.But a trial—or a conviction—will dramatically shrink the space for that straddle, pushing vulnerable Republicans to say with clarity whether all this should be disqualifying in a president.Democrats predict Republicans won’t be able to resist Trump’s pressure. “They’re going to continue to defend him,” Representative Suzan DelBene, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told me. “That will cost them at the ballot box.”A  that 57 percent of Americans say the Justice Department is holding Trump accountable under the law, as opposed to targeting him politically. Among independents that number is also 57 percent. Similar majorities believe Trump is probably or definitely guilty.I believe we’re underestimating another factor here: Trump will soon be facing a jury of his peers. They can’t be smeared as stooges of the “deep state.” The spectacle of Trump facing the judgment of ordinary Americans—just like any American accused of crimes—is likely to mean something powerful to swing voters.A trial could also intensify public attention on whether Trump would simply order his prosecution halted if elected, or, if he’s convicted, whether he’d try to pardon himself. Good luck defending his answer to those questions, vulnerable Republicans.A certain strain in our punditry  that many Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump prosecutions because they no longer trust our institutions or because of some other social malaise. It’s reasonable to lament the state of our institutions. But what if the prosaic reality is that many in the middle of the country are already prepared to accept a guilty verdict for Trump as correct and legitimate?It’s heartening that vulnerable Republicans felt politically obliged to defend the legitimacy of our justice system simply because Stefanik unfurled a dumb MAGA talking point. Now imagine how whipsawed they’ll be if Trump goes on trial—followed by Trump and the MAGA-aligned media furiously demanding that the GOP unanimously declare the proceedings wholly and irredeemably corrupt. Whether or not a conviction is secured by Election Day, all this could worsen GOP divisions—and threaten GOP control of the House in ways few have anticipated.</p>

    <h1>The GOP Is Dying. Time for a Whig Revival?</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Liz Cheney declared Wednesday that the GOP is finished. “The Republican Party,” she  on ABC’s The View, is clearly so caught up in this cult of personality that it’s very hard to imagine that the party can survive. I think increasingly it’s clear that once we get through 2024 we’re gonna have to have something else. Something new. I believe the country has to have a party that’s based on conservative principles and values where we can engage with the Democrats on substance and on policy.Cheney is right. Without artificial support, the body cannot long survive brain death, and the GOP’s brain, as , is pretty obviously dead. The Republican Party maintains a fragile House majority, a narrow majority of governorships, and a larger majority of state legislatures. In the next election, current projections suggest the GOP will lose the House but win back the Senate and, possibly, the presidency. Even so, I agree with Cheney that the Republican Party is running on fumes and that we are witnessing something rare in American politics: the death of a major political party. Historian and author Sean Wilentz told me by email that “I’ve been saying something similar”:[I’ve been saying] that the Republican Party is dead as a doornail, that mainstream parties come and go in American history …  that what was the GOP is now over, having been fully supplanted by an authoritarian political cult. Taking it another step, it’s time everyone in the news media woke up to that fact and owned it. Anything being done under the presumption that the Republican Party still exists (primaries, &c.), that it can be reconstructed after Trump … is sheer fantasy. Some of the Never Trumpers, maybe most, have come to realize this. But covering events, like Iowa, while denying that the GOP is a corpse normalizes the situation, which is extremely dangerous, giving Trump a degree of legitimacy he has long ago lost—or should have lost.I believe the GOP’s death rattle is starting even to penetrate the skulls of most Republican officeholders, at least at the federal level, who aren’t Never Trumpers. They’re too dumbstruck with terror at the moment to do much about it, but given half a chance to drive a stake through Donald Trump’s heart, many would seize it. The difference between Cheney and most of her former Republican colleagues in the House is best measured not by their ideology but by their courage.That said, a new conservative party, if there’s to be one, won’t likely continue the ideological path that the GOP has followed since January 1980, when Ronald Reagan pronounced, “Government is the problem,” or, going back further, since 1955, when William F. Buckley founded National Review in opposition to President Dwight Eisenhower’s accommodationist “.” The American conservative trajectory followed since the 1950s was essentially a war against modern life, and it lasted far longer than anyone (including me) thought possible. But the ease with which the MAGA parasite coopted conservatism demonstrated what a weak host it had become—not least through  when he was vice president. You can’t build a new conservative party on the legacies of Buckley and Reagan. From the looks of it,  wants that anymore.I believe the answer lies, strangely enough, with a revival of the last major political party to die in America. I think Cheney and Mitt Romney and even many Republicans who aren’t yet willing to distance themselves from Trump are drifting toward something resembling the Whig Party, which was born in 1833 and died in 1856. As potential models for a reformed conservative party goes, conservatives could do a lot worse.The Whigs were founded in opposition to the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, which until recent years was regarded as a wellspring of the American liberal tradition because it elevated the common man (read: farmers) at the expense of the elite (read: bankers and industrialists). Franklin Roosevelt, for example,  as Jackson’s legatee. It’s quite different today, of course, when the political figure most eager to associate himself with Jackson is . If today’s liberals are repelled by Jackson’s demagogy against the , by the  he brought into the White House, and by the  killed through his policy of “Indian removal,” today’s conservatives—apart from the blowhard MAGA faction—have no great reason to quarrel with them. The Whigs were opposed to a president (Jackson) acquiring monarchical powers; they adopted the name “Whig” to emulate American colonists who opposed King George III. “They saw Jackson as Caesar,” Wilentz told me in a follow-up conversation to our email exchange. They would not have tolerated Trump’s preposterous and  claims of immunity from prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Nor would they have much regard for the “” theory of maximal presidential power that came into vogue during the Reagan years. The Whigs, whose preeminent leaders were Senators Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Henry Clay of Kentucky, were strong defenders of legislative prerogatives and the rule of law. If American democracy was to be preserved, Clay said, it must be by the practice of virtue, by justice, by moderation, by magnanimity, by greatness of soul, by keeping a watchful and steady eye on the executive.The Whigs even favored (somewhat wrongheadedly) limiting presidents to a . In general, holding the presidency was not something at which the party excelled. “The poor Whigs,” Wilentz told me. “Both of their presidents died in office.” (That would be William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor.)That said, the Whigs did not advocate small government in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson. They understood that the United States required not only a national bank but federally subsidized roads, canals, and other transportation infrastructure to connect far-flung commerce. They would have supported not only Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act but also the (misleadingly named) Inflation Reduction Act, which received not a single Republican vote in Congress, and whose subsidies for green technologies Trump is threatening to  (even though they’ve been a boon to red states). The Whigs would also have favored the , which is helping to drive a  boom in factory construction. The CHIPS Act was opposed by  Republicans in the House and  in the Senate.Something else in the Whigs’ favor: They were cool to manifest destiny, the doctrine that called for relentless and violent Westward expansion. “The Whigs hated that,” Wilentz told me. “They said America should not expand too quickly.” They also, Wilentz explained, saw it as politically advantageous to their opponents, the Democrats.Just to be clear: If conservatives drift into a revived Whig Party, I will not, as a liberal, become a Whig. (I’m just kibbitzing here from the sidelines.) Nor will most Democrats. But it will be possible, as it isn’t today, for Democrats to engage in conversation with Whigs “on substance and policy,” as Cheney puts it.The Whigs were vulnerable to the accusation of elitism. The Democratic Party, founded around the same time as the Whigs, was the party of the ordinary Americans; the Whigs were, especially at the beginning, the party of business. But unlike the current Republican Party (which, for all its populist bluster, is also the party of business), Whigs tended to eschew mythologizing; as Oxford historian Daniel Walker Howe puts it in his 2007 book , “Whig support usually came from environments providing good access to information and an awareness of people and events beyond the immediate horizon.”There were, without question, some Whigs not worth emulating. John C. Calhoun, America’s preeminent defender of slavery, was a Whig. The Whig Party itself succeeded largely by avoiding the divisive issue of slavery, a peace that eventually became impossible to maintain and that led to the party’s collapse; the antislavery Republican Party was created out of its Northern faction. Today there is no slavery to avoid, of course, but the revived Whig Party would not likely lead the nation on matters related to race or diversity. But nor would it likely promote itself, as today’s Republican Party does, through the exploitation of racial animus. A revived Whig Party would also not likely promote taxation of businesses and the rich. But it would likely be more open to compromise with Democrats on taxation in order to keep the federal budget solvent, something today’s Republicans have no particular interest in doing. One especially refreshing aspect to reviving the Whig Party is that conservatives would no longer pretend to represent the working class, creating an opportunity for Democrats to recapture that constituency.The Whig  (when it ran Clay, unsuccessfully, for president; he lost to James Polk) has a remarkably contemporary ring. It called fora well-regulated currency; a tariff [today Whigs would say “tax”] for revenue to defray the necessary expenses of the government, and discriminating with special reference to the protection of the domestic labor of the country; the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands; a single term for the presidency [again: bad idea!]; a reform of executive usurpations;—and, generally—such an administration of the affairs of the country as shall impart to every branch of the public service the greatest practicable efficiency, controlled by a well regulated and wise economy.“I’m a Whig,” David Brooks  in 2018, and he is. He’s always been conservative, but he’s never been especially anti-government. In the late 1990s, Brooks and Bill Kristol advocated something they called “national greatness” conservatism that looked a lot like Whiggery. They  a return to “the nationalism of Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay and Teddy Roosevelt.” They called for a more energetic federal government and dispensed with certain conservative orthodoxies, such as banning abortion. The idea foundered mainly because of its emphasis on military intervention (a doctrine, Wilentz notes, more in line with Bull Moose Republicanism), which came to grief in Iraq. But even here the Whig example is instructive, because the Whigs resisted militarism, most notably when many of them opposed Polk’s Mexican War. The Whigs didn’t last long, but they made a lasting contribution to the United States. As Howe concludes:America’s future lay predominantly within the Whig vision of economic development and a stronger central government.… Eventually the Whig vision prevailed, but only after [former Whig] Abraham Lincoln had vindicated it in the bloodiest of American wars.… As economic modernizers, as supporters of strong national government, and as humanitarians more receptive than their rivals to talent regardless of race or gender, the Whigs deserve to be remembered.Maybe they will be more than remembered. Maybe they’ll be resurrected, as the Republican Party that replaced them north of the Mason-Dixon line itself goes the way of the dodo. I’m not going to join a revived Whig Party myself, but I do think it’s a pretty good idea, and I’ll gladly cheer those conservatives who do. America is a two-party democracy, but nobody ever said we had to keep the same two parties and, historically, we haven’t. Time to try something new that just happens, at the same time, to be old.</p>

    <h1>Flying Less Could Be Fun, Actually</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Even if your flight doesn’t , , or , flying sucks. It’s famously not great for the planet: Aviation accounts for around  of global carbon dioxide emissions. But it’s arguably an even bigger assault on the senses, thanks to an unholy pairing of greedy corporations with a bloated security state whose shared goal would appear to be humiliating everyone involved. (Those companies’ actual goal, rationally speaking, is to turn a profit; our dignity is just collateral damage.)The best lie the fossil fuel industry ever told was that a more carbon-intensive life is a more enjoyable one. For decades, the American right has tried to convince the public that cutting greenhouse gas emissions means accepting a degraded quality of life—hamburgers snatched from hungry hands and dashed summer vacation plans. One might argue, understandably, that emissions and degrading mile-high experiences are a reasonable price to pay for democratizing air travel and opening up the world to people who otherwise wouldn’t have gotten to experience its farther reaches. Some  of U.S. residents have flown commercial in their lifetime, compared to just 25 percent before the industry was  in 1978. Working and middle-class travelers exploring new places, though, or even connecting with far-flung family and friends, is a relatively marginal factor in the massive proliferation of air travel and its associated emissions.  accounts for as much as 75 percent of airline profits. Flights in business class, meanwhile, produce  as many carbon emissions as those in economy. First-class seats are nine times as carbon-intensive. An increasing amount of revenue is also coming from  with major credit card companies. Airlines, in other words, appeal to the rich and treat everyone else like cattle. The industry’s drive to deliver big payouts to shareholders helps explain some of the danger passengers have faced in recent weeks. Luke Goldstein  in The American Prospect that the questionable design of the  that detached midair on an Alaska Airlines flight last week is partly due to designing planes to maximize the number of customers on board, pushed for by budget airlines eager to cram more people in while satisfying requirements to provide a certain number of exit doors per customer. By building plug-in-play fuselages with “cut-outs” that can sub out exit doors for plugs, Boeing has been able to keep costs down while tailoring products to different buyers. As Zeynep Tufecki  this week, writing on the Japan Airlines collision with a Japanese coast guard plane on January 2, flyers have legions of dedicated and highly skilled workers to thank for protecting them against their bosses’ cost-cutting measures. The Lever  that former employees at a Boeing supplier had been raising alarm bells about an “excessive amount of defects” with plane construction, and were allegedly told to falsify documents. Unsurprisingly, airlines’ quest for profits has also led them to seek easy outs from cutting their emissions, which have  since 1987. By 2050, the World Resources Institute finds that aviation could account for between  of global emissions. Delta  legal action over its claims to be the first “carbon-neutral airline,” premised on  carbon-offsetting schemes. Like , international aviation emissions are excluded from the Paris Agreement. That pact is made up of country-level pledges to reduce emissions, and transit between countries presents a thorny accounting challenge. Should the carbon cost of an Emirates flight between New York and Frankfurt, for example, be chalked up to the United States, the European Union, or the United Arab Emirates? The U.N. Agency charged with sorting out this problem—and aligning air travel behind the goals of the Paris Agreement—has routinely taken the easy way out. Last month, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO, made the almost laughably modest pledge of slashing carbon emissions by just  by 2030, under its  to reach “net-zero” emissions by 2050. Airlines’ unenforceable pledges to cut emissions, when they’re made at all, are largely premised on rapid advances in the development of so-called “sustainable aviation fuels” and offsetting schemes. Airlines imagine such advances will allow them to continue growing rapidly. For years, though, ballooning industry emissions have coincided with an increasingly awful flying experience marked by new fees, more cramped seats, and an onslaught of scheduling nightmares. And global warming is helping to make rides bumpier: Rising temperatures have brought instability to the jet stream and a rise in so-called “clear-air” turbulence not caused by stormy, windy conditions. According to a , severe air turbulence over the North Atlantic has increased by more than 50 percent over the last 40 years.  Airlines retain customers in part because the alternatives on offer aren’t exactly appealing—especially in the U.S. High-traffic routes in the so-called Acela Corridor on the East Coast are pricey and prone to delays and disruptions;  aren’t unheard of, either. Train travel between major population centers elsewhere—let alone more rural areas—is even more of a challenge. While visiting friends in California last spring, my partner and I booked an Amtrak ride from San Diego to Oakland. That (optimistically) 12-hour journey hinges on first catching an early morning train to Los Angeles. From there, the Coast Starlight chugs along Southern California’s scenic shores before dipping back through the Central Valley and on up through the Bay Area, continuing on to its final destination in Seattle. Snag a seat in the observation car, and you’ll get views that span from Santa Barbara’s manicured oceanside manses to rock-cliff beaches and hazy fields filled with pump-jacks and almonds. For lunch and dinner you can sign up for a perfectly adequate meal service in the dining car, where Amtrak employees will matchmake parties of two or fewer to populate a four-top. It’s a gorgeous, slightly whimsical, and completely impractical journey. The whole trip takes almost double the time it would in a car. Prices aren’t outrageous by U.S. standards; a coach seat this week will run you about $160. But the lack of reliable Wi-Fi means either taking off a day from work or testing your luck with a mobile hot spot. You’re also liable to hit some kind of snag along the way. When we showed up to board our first leg, a compassionate Amtrak desk attendant informed us that it’d been canceled, with no email or signage indicating as much. There were no alternate routes that’d allow us to make our connection. She disappeared for a few minutes into a back office before informing us that she’d called an Uber to drive us all the way to Downtown Los Angeles’s Union Station, just in time for rush-hour traffic. On vacation this summer, by contrast, I took a stunningly pleasant, functional train journey from Paris to Marseille. Well-equipped three-hour trains between the two cities—just a few miles closer than San Diego and Oakland—run several times a day, and cost between $55 and $110, depending on when you book. You can book a slightly slower ride for less than $20. Last year, France banned domestic flights that can be substituted with train journeys that last two-and-a-half hours or less. You can, that is, still take a flight from Paris to Marseille. But why? By train you can show up 15 minutes before departure in the center of the city, pick up a sandwich for a few Euros, and be deposited out among the bustling old port city’s many restaurants, cafés, and shops after your speedy zip through the French countryside. The Wi-Fi is fast, and the outlets work. Take a plane, and you’ll almost certainly spend more money for the pleasure of trekking miles outside the city hours before your flight and getting herded through a Byzantine national security infrastructure. On the other side awaits a glorified mall filled with overpriced snacks and haggard travelers waiting to be loaded into a sweaty metal tube.France is not some eco-socialist paradise. Its much-hyped short-haul flight ban is  and has eliminated just three routes. Since most high-speed lines are routed through Paris, rail service between even larger cities remains sadly inadequate. Public transit is sparse in more rural areas and often overly oriented toward tourists, particularly in the mountains. Japanese and Austrian public transit riders, among others, might well be appalled by France’s train networks. Americans are easier to impress, of course, since only  of trips in the U.S. are made via public transit.The approach airline CEOs take to the climate challenge is disturbingly similar to official U.S. climate policy: Leave our current way of doing things intact, but make the energy and fuel sources that power it greener. That’s especially true when it comes to transportation, the country’s largest-emitting sector. Air travel accounts for a relatively small portion of that pollution () compared with light-duty vehicles like cars, trucks, and SUVs (53 percent). Despite its generous, uncapped subsidies for electric vehicles, the Inflation Reduction Act is  to make a substantial dent in those figures. The bill offers a  for community transportation improvements that promote walkability and bikeability—just $3 billion—and $1 billion for zero-emissions heavy-duty vehicles, including trucks and school buses. The IRA doesn’t offer any support ​for public transit operations nor capital funding for electrifying transit fleets. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, meanwhile,  $110 billion in highways, bridges, and roads, including for the construction of new motorways and expansions, and $42 billion for airports, ports and waterways. There’s $66 billion for passenger and commercial rail, and $39 billion for public transit. Parallels between uncomfortable air travel and deadly car culture abound, although America’s car-clogged, emissions-plagued roads are a good deal more  than its skies. In an effort to , U.S. automakers have spent the last half-century specializing in big, fast, expensive cars; trucks—perennial —have gotten  heavier since 1990. SUVs and vans with hoods that are 40 inches or taller are  more likely to kill pedestrians than smaller cars. Amid rising traffic deaths, though, federal climate policy is incentivizing consumers to buy bigger,  electric cars. Sedans that cost more than $55,000 are ineligible for electric vehicle tax credits provided by the IRA. The cutoff for trucks and SUVs is $80,000.The alternatives to being stuck on a tarmac or in traffic aren’t just safer and more climate-friendly. They’re more pleasant too. Making these alternatives realistic options in this country, however, requires a shift in how lives and communities here are structured and a head-on confrontation with monied interests. The people who’ve gotten rich off business as usual—oil, car, and airline executives—have spent decades trying to convince the public that those sorts of changes will leave them worse off. Cunningly, they’ve framed air and car travel as a consumer choice and a right—distracting the public from the fact that, for many, there’s no choice in the matter at all.Weary of doing battle with corporate titans, policymakers have compromised by writing policies that gently take some of the carbon out of our deadly, inefficient, pain-in-the-ass status quo. There’s a strong climate case to be made for decarbonization measures that do more than make cars and planes a little bit greener and instead reduce the amount people in the U.S. have to drive and fly overall. For my part, at least, there’s an even more compelling reason to lessen dependence on car and plane travel: They suck!</p>

    <h1>It’s Go Time for the Biden Administration</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 12 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> “Time is running out” is a strange sentence. It’s always true (—I mean from the human perspective), and yet it’s always anxiety-inducing. It’s perfectly calibrated to make the human brain tune out whatever comes next. Time’s running out for me to do it? Great, don’t tell me what it is! I don’t want to know! I’ve practically missed the chance already!Yet time really is running out if the Biden administration means to fulfill its promises to counter climate change and environmental degradation. The climate clock is ticking: Data  Tuesday by the Copernicus Climate Change Service showed that world average temperatures reached 1.48 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels in 2023—shockingly close to the 1.5 degree limit (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The political clock is ticking, as well: With November’s election looming, it’s  that Biden will prevail over the likely Republican nominee, former president and current  Donald Trump. If Trump wins, he’s likely to re-withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and gut environmental protections—a process that could be further abetted by a Republican Congress.The theme in  was hope. Hope certainly hasn’t run out. As The Guardian’s Damian Carrington  readers this week, while the Copernicus Climate Change Service expects us to hit the 1.5 degree mark in the next year, climate scientists won’t consider the target definitively smashed until temperatures are “consistently above 1.5 degrees Celsius.” And as I emphasized last week, even if we cross that milestone, “,” in the words of U.N. climate scientist Jim Skea, will matter. Each of those fractions of a degree will be a major victory counted in lives, livelihoods, species, and communities saved.It is, however, time to get ruthlessly practical about the next 12 months. TNR’s Kate Aronoff has  a to-do list for the Biden administration—not just to get reelected but also to finalize a large number of environmental rules so that it will be harder for Republicans to roll them back. As you may recall, the Trump administration did  to set fire to the environment on its way out the door in 2020, finalizing more than two dozen new giveaways to fossil fuel companies and curtailments of existing environmental policies, during the period between Trump losing the election and Inauguration Day. Biden’s administration might want to take this time to be just as industrious as his predecessor was in wrecking the planet, and protect as much of it as he can in the months that remain.In a  published Wednesday, Kate adds another key item to the to-do list:The Department of Justice prosecuted fewer corporations in fiscal year 2022 than at any point since 1994, per an  published by the watchdog group Public Citizen in October. The overwhelming majority of corporations it did prosecute (81 percent) had fewer than 50 employees, according to the department’s ; just 7 percent had more than 1,000. By its own estimation, enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency reduced, treated, or eliminated fewer pollutants than such efforts have at any point in the last decade. Also in fiscal year 2023, which started in October 2022, the EPA charged  than it has at any point in the last decade.While EPA enforcements increased last year, “the bar for improvement,” Kate wrote, “was shockingly low.… In fiscal year 2022, EPA civil enforcement cases plummeted to their , according to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project. Jail time for criminal defendants reached an all-time low.  were opened in 2022 than at any point since 1992.” While there are demonstrable reasons for that—such as the sharp reduction in agency staff under the Trump administration and stinginess from Congress—there’s a limited amount of time to enforce existing rules before a combination of  and elections could make those agencies’ tasks much, much harder.At the governmental level, policy is about how one uses the time that one has. Politics is about buying more of it. The latter typically outweighs the former in an election year. But if Biden believes, as he has previously stated, that climate change is “,” his administration is going to have to go full-out in the next 12 months to pursue both.Good News/Bad NewsIn a nice break from more villainous tech stories, “a team of beaver scientists and Google engineers have been teaching an algorithm to spot the rodents’ infrastructure on satellite images,”  Ben Goldfarb at Mother Jones. Beavers do a lot of cool things for the environment, and scientists hope to learn more about that from this A.I. effort. Read the full piece: It’s packed with amusing tidbits like A.I. thinking pavement cul-de-sacs are beaver ponds.Fuel efficiency for new cars seems to be stalled,  because of the American love affair with SUVs.Stat of the Week28That’s the number of billion-dollar weather disasters in 2023. You guessed it: . No year going back to the beginning of data collection in 1980, and adjusting for inflation, has seen that many billion-dollar extreme weather events.What I’m ReadingThe Israeli government’s massive months-long assault on Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attacks has already killed a   of people. But as Saqib Rahim reports for Grist, the death toll could rise dramatically even if a cease-fire began tomorrow. Pulverizing this many buildings has surely released toxic debris into the air, including asbestos in some cases. And that’s to say nothing of other environmental degradation:Systematic research after the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States was among the first to link exposure to such a mix of detritus to pulmonary and respiratory disease and cancer.… In principle, making post-conflict zones livable again requires rigorous field sampling, remediation of pollution hotspots, and health surveillance to watch for disease trends. In practice, these things usually get skipped in the exhaustion that follows hostilities …Without ground access to Gaza, observers are relying on remote sensing and publicly available information to measure environmental impacts to the Strip. Using satellite analysis, He Yin, an assistant professor of geography at Kent State University, reckons the fighting has damaged 15 to 29 percent of Gaza’s arable land. The PAX report identifies a plume of black smoke from a soda factory, suggesting burning plastics, and heavy damage at an industrial campus that makes pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, plastics and other chemical goods. In November, the New York Times observed a , a frightening development in one of the most water-stressed places in the world.Read Saqib Rahim’s full report at .This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn.

    <h1>Far-Right Republicans Are Already Talking About Ousting Mike Johnson</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 22:19:08 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> It’s June 2023, and the Republican speaker of the House is struggling to appease the hard-line members of his conference, who are angry that he reached a bipartisan deal on government spending levels. A faction of conservatives  in a rebuke to party leadership.It’s October 2023, and the Republican speaker of the House is facing an internal revolt from members of his own party furious that he forced passage of a  to avert a shutdown. Eight GOP representatives, some of them with a personal grudge against the speaker, join all House Democrats in ousting Kevin McCarthy from the post; after three weeks and much intraparty agita, little-known Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson ascends to the position.It’s January 2024, and the Republican speaker of the House is struggling to appease the hard-line members of his conference, who are angry that he has reached a bipartisan deal on government spending levels. On Wednesday, a faction of conservatives  in a rebuke to party leadership.Political observers could be forgiven for developing an acute case of déjà vu. Far-right anger over a government funding agreement, conservative frustration over yet another temporary measure to keep the government funded, and a razor-thin Republican majority in the House: These are the conditions that led to McCarthy losing the gavel last fall. Although most House Republicans believe that Johnson is in a more secure place than his predecessor, the uncertainty surrounding the future of government funding has raised the specter of another speakership fight.Johnson  with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer over the weekend, the numbers in line with the deal struck between McCarthy and President Joe Biden last year. Because the deadline to keep the government funded is fast approaching—without congressional action, four agencies will shut down next week, followed by eight additional agencies at the beginning of February—Congress may once again pass a stopgap measure to temporarily avert a shutdown. On Thursday, Schumer started the process for passing a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open.But the deal reached with Schumer rests on a shaky foundation. Johnson met with several members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus on Thursday, some of whom left the speaker’s office under the impression that a new deal on government funding would be reached. “It’s not going to be the current deal,” Representative Ralph Norman told reporters. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said that Johnson is “going to have to go back to the drawing table.”However, Johnson himself said that no commitment had been made, raising questions  about his ability to communicate effectively with his members. “We had a cross section of members in today, will continue having cross sections of members in, and while those conversations are going on, I’ve made no commitments. So if you hear otherwise, it’s just simply not true,” Johnson said after the meeting.Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, indicated that reneging on the deal with Democrats would undermine Republican credibility. “In this process, the most important thing is your word. And so if you break your word, you can never negotiate anything,” Diaz-Balart told reporters. “Like it or not, we have a top-line agreement.”Some Senate Republicans were just as dismissive of potential efforts to rewrite the deal. “I don’t believe Speaker Johnson wants to shut down the government. I do know there are people in his party who do. But they’re the same ones who were OK with us not having a speaker for two weeks, so I’m not particularly interested in their strategic advice,” Senator Thom Tillis told reporters. (It was actually around three weeks between McCarthy’s ouster and Johnson’s election as speaker this past October.)There are several structural factors working against Johnson, not least of which is the extremely narrow majority he’s working with, as well as increasing political polarization. But he may not have been as well equipped as his predecessor to work under these conditions. Unlike McCarthy, Johnson is relatively inexperienced, having been elected to the House in 2016 and only served in a minor leadership role prior to assuming the speakership. He was immediately thrown into the deep end of handling major issues that would be tricky for any party leader. Although Republicans hold the House, Democrats control the White House and Senate, limiting Johnson’s power. Moreover, Biden, Schumer, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have served for decades longer than Johnson and are each skilled and experienced negotiators. GOP Representative Frank Lucas argued that Johnson needed to be forceful with the House Republican conference. “Speaker Johnson has to continue to demonstrate the strength and certainty that is the nature of his personality. This is a body—it doesn’t matter Democrat caucus or Republican conference—if they spot your weaknesses, you’re in a world of hurt,” Lucas said.Indeed, some House Republicans have warned that Johnson’s job may be in jeopardy if he holds to the current government funding deal—a familiar threat to anyone who remembers McCarthy’s brief tenure as speaker. Representative Chip Roy, who  if funding is not tied to a hard-line border policy bill,  that moving to remove Johnson is “not the road I’d prefer,” but added, “We’ll see what happens this week.” Representative Warren Davidson  this week that Johnson “should never have been hired.”Greene  on Thursday that ousting Johnson was “absolutely on the table,” and said on Steve Bannon’s podcast that she had “had it” with Johnson’s dealmaking with Senate Democrats. (Earlier this week,  that “Chip Roy haphazardly throwing in a motion to vacate is probably about the dumbest thing that could happen.”)Still, some Republicans were skeptical that Johnson would face an effort to remove him from the speakership. “It’s a new day, different dynamics. We move on,” said GOP Representative Byron Donalds, explaining that he didn’t think Johnson would face McCarthy’s fate.Diaz-Balart argued that Johnson still had conservative bona fides, the deal with Schumer notwithstanding, indicating that far-right rabble-rousing might have self-serving motivations. “I think there’s a number of people that will do anything to get on TV, to get to be a celebrity. But the reality is that there’s nobody more conservative than Speaker Johnson in this House,” he said.Other Republicans just hope that the recalcitrant cadre of conservatives remember the frustration and gridlock that accompanied the previous fight over electing a new speaker. “I am hoping that some of the folks who are on the crankier side see it didn’t really get them anything,” said Representative David Schweikert. “Reality sometimes is that kick in the head.”Representative Dusty Johnson lumped Democrats in with the few Republicans who  voted to oust McCarthy, arguing that members across both parties might be reticent to remove another speaker so soon. “I think many, maybe most of the people who … voted for the disastrous motion to vacate understand how terrible it was and how disruptive it was,” Johnson said. “It took 218 to throw the guy out. I think a big chunk of that 218, as Americans, understand that that made America weaker.”</p>

    <h1>Trump Launches Into Berserk Tirade in Fraud Trial—as Judge Tells Him to Shut Up</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 20:11:13 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Donald Trump on Thursday burst into a rant, which he reportedly spent days , during the last day of his civil fraud trial.Trump had wanted to present his own closing arguments, which the presiding judge, , said he could do so long as the former president abided by a strict  about what he could actually discuss. This included sticking to the matter at hand instead of giving “a campaign speech” and not attacking New York Attorney General Letitia James or the courtroom staff. When Trump’s lawyers  to agree, Engoron barred Trump from speaking, a move that Trump called “MEAN & NASTY” on TruthSocial.During the trial, Trump’s lawyer asked if his client could address the court. Engoron asked if Trump would keep his comments to the facts and evidence at hand, which Trump apparently took as a green light to go right ahead.“This is a political witch hunt, and that should be set aside,” Trump cut in. “We should receive damages for what we went through.”“This is a fraud on me,” he continued to rave. “What’s happened here, sir, is a fraud on me.”“We have a situation where I’m an innocent man. I’ve been persecuted by somebody running for office, and I think you have to go outside the bounds.”There is no evidence linking President Joe Biden to the lawsuit. New York’s attorney general sued Trump for fraud.Trump complained for several minutes about the trial and legal proceedings. He even  he had spoken with an insurance executive from Zurich who said they hadn’t been defrauded by Trump.Trump also insisted he had never had a problem, but Engoron interjected to point out that Trump has been sued before.“Isn’t that a problem?” Engoron asked.The judge eventually told Trump’s lawyers to “control your client.”Trump requested earlier this week to deliver his own closing arguments. He apparently spent days rehearsing an appropriately aggrieved and biting speech,  reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources. Clearly, Trump wasn’t about to let Engoron’s decision stop him from getting his moment in the spotlight.James accused Trump, his sons , the Trump Organization, and other company executives of  the value of various real estate assets to get more favorable terms on bank loans. Engoron  in September that Trump committed fraud and ordered that all Trump’s New York business certificates be canceled, making it nearly impossible to do business in the state and effectively killing the Trump Organization. The current trial is primarily just to determine how much Trump owes in damages.</p>

    <h1>West Virginia Bill Could Ban All Transgender People From Schools</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 19:15:15 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A West Virginia Republican lawmaker has introduced a bill that would classify transgender people as “obscene matter” and ban them from getting within 2,500 feet of a school., which was introduced Wednesday, prohibits obscene matter from being within 2,500 feet of a  building or facility. Obscene materials are defined as something that is sexually explicit “in a patently offensive way” or something that “lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”The bill states that, for the sake of protecting children, obscenity also includes “any transvestite and/or transgender exposure, performances or display to any minor.”Any school faculty or staff that allow obscene material within 2,500 feet of the school can face up to a year in prison, a fine of up to $500, or both. The bill, which was introduced by Republican state Senator Michael Azinger, makes no mention of how the new rules would affect transgender students.Besides the obvious transphobia of the bill, which dehumanizes trans people by classifying them as “materials,” the measure would also dramatically increase the criminalization of trans people. Obscenity laws are , because definitions of obscenity still largely come down to individual interpretation. As a result, there will likely be more reports of obscenity, made by people who are either more conservative or just nervous about accidentally breaking the law.Azinger’s bill, like many other  curbing , is not intended to protect children or prevent public displays of indecency—or even necessarily stand up to legal challenges. The vaguely worded text is primarily meant to .This bill is the latest in West Virginia’s assault on trans rights. In March 2023, Governor Jim Justice signed a bill banning  for trans and nonbinary minors. Gender-affirming treatments such as hormone therapy and reversible puberty blockers are widely backed by the medical community and have been proven to decrease depression and suicidality in trans and nonbinary teens.</p>

    <h1>The Five Most Powerful Moments in The Hague’s Israel Genocide Case</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 17:28:10 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The United Nations’ top court on Thursday held the first public hearings in a case accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.South Africa brought the case, charging Israel with violating the U.N.’s 1948 Genocide Convention, which was established in the wake of the Holocaust. South Africa is asking the International Court of Justice to order an immediate end to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has thus far killed more than 23,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire population.During Thursday’s hearing, a team of South African ambassadors and lawyers began presenting the case against Israel. Here are some of the most powerful things they said:1. “The first genocide in history where its victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real time in the desperate, so far vain hope that the world might do something.”"The first genocide in history where its victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real time in the desperate, so far vain hope that the world might do something."Blinne Ni Ghralaigh at the ICJ in the Hague — Saul Staniforth (@SaulStaniforth) Irish lawyer Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, representing South Africa, delivered these powerful remarks:The international community continues to fail the Palestinian people, despite the overt dehumanizing genocidal rhetoric by Israeli governmental and military officials matched by the Israeli’s army’s actions on the ground. Despite the horror of the genocide against the Palestinian people, being livestreamed from Gaza to our mobile phones, computers, and television screens, the first genocide in history where its victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real time in the desperate, so far vain hope that the world might do something.2. “The terrible new acronym born out of Israel’s genocidal assault on the Palestinian population in Gaza.”Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh who is supporting South Africa's legal team at the ICJ, says the number of orphans caused by ‘Israel’s genocidal assault on the Palestinian population in Gaza’ has led to the need for a new acronym: WCNSF - wounded child, no surviving family. — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) “On the basis of the current figures, on average, 247 Palestinians are being killed and are at risk of being killed each day, many of them literally blown to pieces,” Ní Ghrálaigh warned.“They include 48 mothers each day, two every hour. And over 117 children each day. Leading UNICEF to call Israel’s actions a war on children. Entire multigenerational families will be obliterated and yet more children will become WCNSF—wounded child, no surviving family—the terrible new acronym born out of Israel’s genocidal assault on the Palestinian population in Gaza.”3. “Ongoing Nakba of the Palestinian people through Israel’s colonization since 1948.”Vusi Mandonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands, opened the genocide case by referencing Israel’s system of colonization, apartheid, and occupation. He also referenced the Nakba, the Arabic word for “catastrophe” which is used to describe the mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland upon Israel’s creation in 1948.His remarks gave greater context to the war we are witnessing today:South Africa has recognized the ongoing Nakba of the Palestinian people through Israel’s colonization since 1948, which has systematically and forcibly dispossessed, displaced and fragmented the Palestinian people, deliberately denying them the internationally recognized inalienable right to self determination and their internationally recognized rights of return as refugees to their towns and villages in what is now the state of Israel.We are also particularly mindful of Israel’s institutionalized regime of discriminatory laws, policies, and practices designed and maintained to establish domination, subjecting the Palestinian people to apartheid on both sides of the.Decades-long impunity for widespread and systematic human rights violations has emboldened Israel in its recurrence and intensification of international crimes in Palestine.At the outset, South Africa acknowledges that the genocidal acts and omissions by the state of Israel inevitably form part of a continuum of illegal acts perpetrated against the Palestinian people since 1948.The application places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.4. “This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life. It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared. Not even newborn babies.”Adila Hassim, another lawyer presenting South Africa’s case, described Israel’s “unparalleled and unprecedented killing.”In schools, in hospitals, in mosques, in churches, and as they tried to find food and water for their families. They have been killed if they failed to evacuate, killed in the places to which they have fled, and even killed while they attempted to flee along Israeli declared safe routes.The level of killing is so extensive that those whose bodies are found are buried in mass graves, often unidentified.In the first three weeks alone, following 7 October, Israel deployed 6,000 bombs per week. At least 200 times it has deployed 2000 pound bombs in southern areas of Palestine designated as safe. These bombs have also decimated the north, including refugee camps. Two thousand pound bombs are some of the biggest and most destructive bombs available. They are dropped by lethal fighter jets that are used to strike targets on the ground by one of the world’s most resourced armies. Israel has killed an unparalleled and unprecedented number of civilians. With the full knowledge of how many civilian lives each bomb will take.More than 1,800 Palestinian families in Gaza have lost multiple family members and hundreds of multigenerational families have been wiped out with no remaining survivors. Mothers, fathers, children, siblings, grandparents, aunts, cousins, often all killed together.This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life. It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared. Not even newborn babies.5. “Genocides are never declared in advance, but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts.”Hassim went on to outline the crimes Israel has committed over the last 97 days: All of these acts individually and collectively form a calculated pattern of conduct by Israel indicating a genocidal intent. This intent is evident from Israel’s conduct in:Targeting Palestinians living in Gaza using weaponry that causes large scale, homicidal destruction, as well as targeted sniping of civilians.Designating safe zones for Palestinians to seek refuge and then bombing these.Depriving Palestinians in Gaza of basic needs—food, water, health care, fuel, sanitation, and communications.Destroying social infrastructure, homes, schools, mosques, churches, hospitals, and killing, seriously injuring, and leaving large numbers of children orphaned.Genocides are never declared in advance but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly, a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts.</p>

    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 17:10:24 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Donald Trump  it’s OK that he got paid by foreign governments while he was president because he was “doing services” for them.Trump participated in a Fox News town hall Wednesday night instead of the . At one point, he was asked about a recent congressional  that found he made almost $8 million from nearly two dozen foreign governments during his first two years in office.Trump  the amount as “a small amount of money.”“You know, it sounds like a lot of money. That’s small,” he said.He then said that it was fine he had received so much money because it was payment for accommodation at his various clubs and hotels.“I was doing services for them,” Trump explained. “People were staying in these massive hotels, these beautiful hotels.”“I don’t get $8 million for doing nothing.”Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a  last week that found Trump’s businesses had received at least $7.8 million from at least 20 different countries. The report acknowledged that its findings were likely incomplete, as it covers just half of Trump’s presidency and transactions at just four of his more than 500 businesses.The money came from some of the “world’s most unsavory regimes,” according to the report, and Trump never asked for congressional approval to keep the funds, as mandated by the Constitution.The countries included China—which gave Trump $5.5 million, the largest sum listed in the report—Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Hungary.The report came as Republicans are trying to impeach  for allegedly benefiting from his son Hunter’s overseas . But the GOP has yet to produce  of wrongdoing by the president.</p>

    <h1>Florida’s War on Books Has Found a New Casualty: The Dictionary</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 16:17:49 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A Florida school district has  multiple versions of the dictionary for including sexual content. Yes, you read that right.The Escambia County School District, located in Florida’s Panhandle, has allegedly removed five dictionaries, eight encyclopedias, The Guinness Book of World Records, and Ripley’s Believe It or Not from its library shelves after a  found those books could violate House Bill 1069. Those reference books are among  that the December investigation found inappropriate for county school library shelves. Other  include Anne Frank’s Diary of a Young Girl, some Sherlock Holmes books, and the autobiographies of Beyoncé, Oprah, and Lady Gaga.“We can’t believe we have to say this but students have a right to read the dictionary in school,” the ACLU  in a TikTok posted Wednesday.With the latest purge, Escambia County has now pulled more than  from its library shelves because they might violate state law on teaching students about sex and sexuality. The other banned books cover subjects including race, racism, and LGBTQ identity. The nonprofit organization PEN America, along with county students and parents, has  the school district for banning books. Florida Republican lawmakers dramatically  Governor Ron DeSantis’s hallmark “Don’t Say Gay” legislation in May 2023. The legislation bans teaching material on sexual orientation and gender identity through eighth grade. The law also makes it easier for people to file complaints to ban books.Since the law went into effect, Florida schools have undergone massive  from both classroom and school libraries.

    <h1>Congress May Finally Pass a Child Tax Credit—but Will It Pay Off for Families?</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 16:09:36 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> There’s a lot of news on the child tax credit this week, so I’m focusing the full newsletter on that topic. Rest assured, the key deals dominating conversation in Congress—on funding the government, foreign aid, and the border—will be live issues going forward. But the chances of a bipartisan deal on a critical anti-poverty measure is my favorite story on Capitol Hill this week.I  that the top members of the tax-writing committees in the House and Senate are close to hashing out a deal on legislation that would expand the child tax credit and implement business-friendly tax benefits and deductions. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, a Republican, have been negotiating an agreement for several months, and lawmakers believe that they are close to creating compromise legislation amenable to both parties.Democrats have long aimed to reinstate some version of the expanded child tax credit that was briefly implemented by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, which drastically lowered child poverty during the six months it was in effect. However, it appears that one of the key elements of the expanded child tax credit that helped alleviate child poverty may not be included in the final tax deal.Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee told reporters on Wednesday that they had been briefed on a framework that would cost around $70 billion, with $35 billion each for the expanded child tax credit and business tax benefits. Democrats said they were told it would be paid for in part by ending employee retention tax credit claims. The framework discussed would also increase partial refundability of the child tax credit, without providing full refundability for the poorest Americans. However, a source familiar with the negotiations between Wyden and Smith cautioned that the numbers related by House Democrats were not final and that there were still elements of a deal under consideration.The American Rescue Plan Act eliminated the earnings requirement for the credit and allowed families too poor to pay income taxes to claim it—a provision colloquially known as “full refundability.” The American Rescue Plan Act also increased the amount of the credit and disbursed it on a monthly basis, instead of an annual lump sum. During the six months that it was in effect, from July through December 2021, this measure contributed to a dramatic decrease in child poverty, as well as a drop in food insecurity among families with children.Although the decrease in child poverty in 2021 was due to a combination of those changes to the child tax credit, the refundability portion was perhaps the most significant expansion, because it allowed parents without income tax liability to still access the credit. Under current law, the $2,000 credit is only refundable up to $1,600.“The refundability piece is critical, because you can’t just raise benefit levels on their own and expect to see these gaps close,” said Megan Curran, the policy director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. Curran and her colleagues  finding that 18 million children under age 17 were ineligible for the full credit—including 91 percent of children living below the poverty line and 36 percent in households living between 100 and 200 percent of the poverty line.Democrats have been unsuccessfully working to revive the credit for years, and the current negotiations appear to be the closest lawmakers have come to a deal. However, Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee were unhappy with the numbers they were seeing from Wyden and Smith’s talks.“This has to be a CTC tax package that makes that kind of profound difference in people’s lives. And right now, I don’t think they’re there yet,” said Representative Jimmy Gomez, a member of the Ways and Means Committee.Representative Don Beyer told reporters that “it’s definitely not enough.” “There’s no refundability, which we’ve always wanted. It’s not monthly, which we’ve always wanted. It does move the dollar amount up, which is good,” said Beyer. Democrats said that the amount refundable would be $2,000 by 2025, matching the amount of the nonrefundable credit.Partial refundability meant that low- to middle-income children do not receive the full credit, as well as children in very poor households. Moreover, the amount available changes based on how many children a household has: For example, a parent with one child would need to earn around $31,000 per year to obtain the full credit, while a parent with two children would need to have an annual salary of $36,000.Under the current framework being discussed, people earning under $2,500 would be ineligible. The credit would still phase in at a 15 percent rate for each dollar of earnings above $2,500. But rather than getting up to 15 percent of annual income in tax credits capped at $1,600 per year—the refundable amount of the current credit—those eligible would receive 15 percent of their income capped at $2,000 in 2025.A source familiar with the negotiations also said that the framework would phase in the credit per child, allowing parents with multiple children to receive a higher amount.  by the Tax Policy Center found that phasing in the credit at a rate of 15 percent per child would “benefit 23 percent of families in the lowest income quintile by an average of $270.”Democratic senators also appeared more sanguine with the turn of events than their House counterparts.“It’s not going to be everything that I would’ve wanted,” Senator Michael Bennet, a Democratic member of the Finance Committee and longtime advocate for expanding the credit, told me on Wednesday. “We weren’t going to do any extensions of the [research and development] tax credit without improvements to the child tax credit, that’s going to make a difference here, and that’ll make a difference to a lot of poor kids.”Some progressives voiced their frustration with the possible deal in a meeting of Democrats on the Finance Committee Wednesday morning. But Wyden noted that because the credit would be “relitigated,” it would give Democrats the opportunity to push for some of their priorities—such as full refundability—again in 2025.“I’d much rather get into 2025 from a position of strength, which is what we get if we get the child tax credit improved now,” Wyden told me.Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers appear pleased about the addition of benefits and deductions for businesses in a potential deal, even if it’s still unclear when an agreement will be formally announced. Smith told me that he believed “pro-growth tax policies” would be crucial for combating inflation.“The three tax provisions of R&D, business expensing, and interest expensing—those are crucial, and they’re crucial for Republicans and they’re crucial for Democrats,” said Representative Blake Moore, a Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. However, he acknowledged that the future of such legislation is uncertain, adding: “I don’t have any visibility on how it plays out. I don’t think anybody truly, truly does.”Lawmakers would want to pass a deal by the end of January, to allow for the credits to retroactively apply to the 2023 tax year. But that gives them little time to reach an agreement, and it’s uncertain what vehicle they would use to pass such comprehensive tax legislation. The opacity of the deal’s future was echoed by Neal, who sounded more bearish on its prospects. “This idea that it’s just around the corner doesn’t seem to be very plausible,” he told reporters.What I’m Reading, by Yours Truly.

    <h1>Last Day of Trump’s Fraud Trial Starts With a Bomb. Almost Literally.</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 15:06:34 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The final day of Donald Trump’s New York civil fraud trial kicked off Thursday with a bomb threat at the presiding judge’s house.Nassau County police as well as a bomb squad rushed to Judge Arthur Engoron’s house on Long Island after someone threatened to blow up the dwelling Thursday morning,  first reported. The threat is believed to be an attempt to delay closing arguments in Trump’s trial. It is unclear whether proceedings will be affected.The bomb threat came just hours after Trump posted a long rant on TruthSocial complaining about Engoron. Trump accused Engoron of colluding with New York Attorney General Letitia James to “‘SCREW ME,’ EVEN THOUGH I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG.”“THIS IS A RIGGED AND UNFAIR TRIAL—NO JURY, NO VICTIMS, A GREAT FINANCIAL STATEMENT—JUST BEFORE THE IMPORTANT IOWA PRIMARY—ELECTION INTERFERENCE,” Trump wrote.Trump wanted to present his own closing arguments, which Engoron said he could do so long as the former president abided by a strict  about what he could actually discuss. This included sticking to the matter at hand instead of giving “a campaign speech” and not attacking James or the court staff. When Trump’s lawyers  to agree, Engoron barred Trump from speaking, a move that Trump called “MEAN & NASTY” on TruthSocial.James has accused Trump, his sons , the Trump Organization, and other company executives of  the value of various real estate assets to get more favorable terms on bank loans. Engoron  in September that Trump committed fraud and ordered that all Trump’s New York business certificates be canceled, making it nearly impossible to do business in the state and effectively killing the Trump Organization.The current trial is primarily just to determine how much Trump owes in damages. And there isn’t a jury because his own legal team  to ask for one.Trump has repeatedly taken aim at Engoron and his law clerk  throughout the trial,  them both of improper actions and bias. Engoron has saddled Trump with multiple , but the judge and Greenfield have still received multiple death threats from Trump supporters.This is at least the third time that Trump supporters have tried to  on one of the former president’s perceived enemies. In the past few weeks, both Judge Tanya Chutkan and special counsel Jack Smith have been the victims of . Swatting is when someone falsely reports an incident with the intent of initiating a potentially dangerous police response.Smith has indicted Trump for mishandling classified documents and for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election. Chutkan is presiding over the election interference case. Trump has complained bitterly about both people on social media.</p>

    <h1>The Book of Ayn Trolls Us All</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> May 2018 was a pivotal moment for people we might now call “anti-woke” thinkers. When Bari Weiss put together a feature on “,” writers and academics who churned out books and blog posts on political correctness suddenly acquired the sheen of glamour that comes from having a forbidden or dissident point of view. The piece, which profiled “a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities” who felt “locked out of legacy outlets,” ran with moody portraits of the likes of Joe Rogan, Eric Weinstein (then managing director of Thiel Capital), and Michael Shermer (publisher of Skeptic magazine). The group bemoaned the “siege” on their perverted sense of free speech. But their thought crimes also seemed to be serving them pretty well.Like the Intellectual Dark Web’s mavericks, Anna, the 39-year-old protagonist and narrator of Lexi Freiman’s rollicking satire , is addicted to “the verboten,” to “the dizzy zing of the counterintuitive” and the attention that airing it brings. Anna believes that her contrarianism has gotten her canceled—The New York Times has panned her new novel, a satire of the opioid epidemic that she wrote in a family friend’s Madison Avenue pied-à-terre, calling the book “classist” and deeming Anna a “narcissist.” Anna also studiously avoided the trauma plot, to the chagrin of the Times, which accused her of “under-contextualization.”Wounded by the Times and dropped by her publisher, Anna slides not into the alt-right, but into the rational selfishness of Ayn Rand. Smarting after being shunned by the literary collective, she soothes herself with Rand’s philosophy of individualism, the sense that “being your own raison d’être resolved all questions of meaning and purpose.” At first blush, it’s an odd choice of hero: Rand isn’t even especially popular among the anti-woke set. Shortly after diving into Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, Anna attends a “dissident soiree” in a West Village townhouse with the likes of “furloughed boomer editorialists, Black libertarian Substackers … and socially dysfunctional moderates out for a good time”—an updated Intellectual Dark Web. Even there, she can’t find fellow Rand fans. A pair of Dimes Square girls call Rand “a bit basic” and are quick to pivot to a man who might introduce them to Peter Thiel.The Book of Ayn is not a novel that satirizes the Annas and Ayns of the world in order to sketch out a more compelling left-wing vision. Nor is the novel merely a satire. Freiman’s debut, Inappropriation, an irreverent take on identity politics in the package of a coming-of-age novel, proved her dexterity at picking apart sacrosanct stances while also plumbing the depths of the desire to belong. The Book of Ayn accrues similar layers: Anna’s tailspin becomes an epic hero’s journey through New York, Los Angeles, and Lesvos; a Künstlerroman of a novelist in a midlife crisis; a picaresque quest for meaning.Freiman smartly sidesteps politics and polemics—mercifully, the novel never mentions Trump. She makes The Book of Ayn instead a novel saturated with avoided grief, wherein Anna must grapple with her record of “yoking myself to bad ideas since I was three years old”—the age when her baby brother died and she responded by smearing her own poop on her parents’ bedroom walls. Freiman presents a case against “,” examining what Anna’s refusal to conform to narrative expectations in life and in art has cost her, and how she might find a path forward. In this, The Book of Ayn is both more and less transgressive than its title makes it seem; Anna’s provocative posturing serves as armor against pain. Unlike much of the Intellectual Dark Web, Anna has a sense of humor about her cancellation. “Truthfully, I’d known that scatological humor was now banned from descriptions of the rural poor,” she explains. She was just trying to “bring a little slapstick to the ongoing national tragedy.” Perhaps her greatest thought crime was refusing to believe “that people were products of their circumstance.” Anna had chosen to make “certain characters selfish without explaining why. I had simply put them in their adult lives with a puppy and a bag of heroin.” The Book of Ayn is both more and less transgressive than its title makes it seem; Anna’s provocative posturing serves as armor against pain. Anna is thus not so much a reactionary as an edgelord reveling in “the soft stuff of moral subtlety,” Freiman opting to take her on an absurdist quest for artistic and personal fulfillment, a quest that ultimately forces her to reckon with her own circumstances. Freiman’s novel trots briskly across the globe but packs its two parts with scatology, philosophy, fertility, sex, a brief moment of virality, a woke Seinfeld remake, goat yoga, literal death and ego death, and a Greek commune that recalls the Rajneeshpuram of Wild Wild Country. The breakneck pace both affords comedic effect—Freiman works an outrageous line of dialogue or image into nearly every page—and enacts Anna’s spiral, as she flings her whole being into the embrace of one radical philosophy and then another. Anna gloms onto Rand and then onto “the truly spectacular pariah” who founded the commune in a mode that mimics the Intellectual Dark Web’s embrace of reactionary ideologies—she is attempting to revive her career after realizing that her original schtick is unsustainable. That the one thing she has been avoiding all along—the trauma of her brother’s death, which she doesn’t even believe belongs to her—might hold the key is obvious to the reader but repulsive to Anna.Instead, she distracts herself with more immediate tasks: soothing her wounded ego and resurrecting her artistic brand. Reveling in the apparent originality of making a Randian worldview her entire identity, Anna flees Manhattan for Los Angeles. She’s connected with a manager who wants her to write a half-hour comedy about Rand, whose work she has barely had time to read, let alone comprehend. No matter—Anna, who loves a good paradox, believes she can cancel herself into a more lucrative career. She’s determined to write a “funny homage” to Rand that contains no trauma and no character arc. Freiman, who also writes for television, sends up the whims of the industry—the manager’s ask soon morphs into an hour-length animated historical comedy.It seems for a moment that Anna might be able to deliver. In L.A., she serendipitously finds herself in an apartment building full of Gen Z-ers making micro-content for an app she mishears as being called “Jizz.” The app’s users apply animal avatar filters to “behave in ways that were off-limits to human beings.” While flirting with her neighbor, who uses a Labrador filter to “embody idiocy,” she allows him to film her babbling about Rand’s takes on “the empty moral center of altruism, the self-sacrificing impulse at the heart of socialism. The death drive, which I knew almost nothing about.” He applies a horned sheep filter; Anna becomes Ayn Ram, goes viral, and believes she’s found a way to transmute radical selfishness for a television audience. When Anna is forced to admit that she’d been ignoring the fact that Rand can’t joke and that the virtue of selfishness was a bad idea at the root of “the emptiness of modern life,” she wallows momentarily in her own stupidity. In these scenes, Freiman gives depth to a character who might otherwise stall out as a troll oblivious to her own contradictions—depth that hinges on the dreaded backstory. Family matters call Anna back to New York, and Freiman extends the meditative moment for a few beats longer. Depressed and living with her disapproving mother, who keeps a “shelf of photo albums with their cluttered pages and all the little sinkholes of grief,” Anna seems on the verge of understanding what’s underneath her impulse to be contrary, to give credence to “the disreputable side.” She almost admits to her mother that she had wrapped herself in Randian self-interest because caring—about others, about anything—“felt like death, like disappearing.” This is the expected emotional climax of the novel, but Freiman’s not done putting Anna through the wringer. Soon, a friend sends an email about an ego death workshop at a commune in Lesvos, and she’s off for an adventure that recalls “Eat Pray Love narrated by Humbert Humbert.” The relentlessness of Anna’s seesawing between revelations and self-deceptions in Lesvos gets a bit tiresome, as does her love affair with a barely legal Slav with blond dreads who wholeheartedly loves both the commune’s deceased Master and Tom Cruise.Ultimately, though, this Greek jaunt serves to bring Anna back to her writing, which promises her a path forward. Anna’s quest across The Book of Ayn is for her next artistic project, one that doesn’t feel so empty at its core. In order to get there, she has to reckon, finally, with what’s been driving her rebellion against caring too much for or about anything but handsome young boys all along. That Freiman literally cakes Anna’s trauma narrative in shit—feces torment her across the novel—feels apropos. She is, after all, fucking with us.</p>

    <h1>Mike DeWine Is Following the Right’s Vicious Abortion Playbook on Trans Health Care</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Last month, Ohio became the latest state to  on gender-affirming care for minors—part of the wave of anti-trans legislation across the country. Then at the last minute, Republican Governor Mike DeWine seemed to offer relief, announcing on December 29 that he would veto the ban, formally known as House Bill 68. From  to  to , LGBTQ rights groups praised DeWine, a  Republican, for flipping the right’s “” script to argue against the ban: “Many parents have told me that their child would not have survived, would be dead today, if they had not received the treatment they received from one of Ohio’s children’s hospitals,” DeWine  when announcing his veto.But DeWine’s veto wasn’t what it seemed. In the same press release that announced the veto, the governor said he was  government agencies to adopt new “administrative rules” on gender-affirming care that would put care out of reach for many trans Ohioans—minors and adults. On January 5, he  this plan via executive order: new mandates that providers submit detailed data on care provision to the state every six months and new requirements that anyone seeking care get the approval of a team including a psychiatrist, an endocrinologist, and a bioethicist. While getting credit for vetoing one ban, DeWine is proposing another ban in all but name.“All of the proposed rules are unnecessary, harmful, and cruel,” Dara Adkison, board secretary of , told me this week. “They contradict current well-established medical guidelines  by national and international standards. These rules stand to harm all trans, nonbinary, intersex, and gender-nonconforming people in the state, but particularly those who are Black and/or in the rural portions of Ohio.”The confusing, demoralizing about-face seemed designed to provide deniability to DeWine’s administration. Headlines did not acknowledge this when reporting the veto. “,” The New York Times reported. Fox News went with: “.” DeWine’s  on January 5 did exactly what his veto press release promised: banned gender-affirming surgery for minors and initiated the administrative rule process for additional restrictions, emphasizing that these rules would “go well beyond what was in House Bill 68.” For example, as he continued, “I am concerned that there could be fly-by-night providers or clinics, that might be dispensing medication to adults with no counseling, no basic standards to ensure quality of care.” (He didn’t offer evidence that this is happening in the state—only his feeling that this “could” be happening.)The attempt to “soften” or “compromise” on a ban on gender-affirming care by instead proposing strict guidelines that could make care impossible to access may seem familiar. It’s the same playbook conservatives followed with onerous administrative rules around abortion during the Roe years: If you cannot ban abortion outright, then you attempt to administrate clinics out of existence. Such regulations have little (if not nothing) to do with health, safety, and medical ethics and everything to do with creating unnecessary risks for those providing health care. They also give those who oppose this care a way of couching their opposition in other terms: Rather than a “ban,” they say they support gender-affirming care with more data collection and oversight; care that is more “.” In other words, they say they want more control over the process. In this case, as the ACLU  in a recent statement, these restrictions “could amount to a de facto ban on care for transgender youth and adults.”“In many ways, this outcome is even worse than the lack of a veto,”  Zinnia Jones, a researcher and writer of , about DeWine’s new strategy. Jones has been analyzing and  on similar efforts at using administrative rules to limit access to gender-affirming care, as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis  in 2022. “While this was previously a question of whether gender-affirming medical care for youth would be banned or not, this veto has instead been used as an opportunity to target and restrict care for transgender adults, a vastly larger segment of the trans population than youth.” Some of the rules proposed concern health care providers, for instance  they report every “diagnosis of a gender-related condition” to the Ohio state Department of Health within 30 business days. The rules also mandate that providers track and report the age, “biological sex,” “specific information about the nature of any diagnosis,” their “treatment plan” (such as hormone replacement therapy), and if those individuals cease treatment or “detransition.” The Health Department is directed to “share aggregate data collected pursuant to this rule” every six months with the state legislature and the public. Anything can be made public so long as it is “in summary, statistical, or aggregate form.” How, or if, this data is meant to improve health outcomes is not proposed or described. It’s also unclear why the state wants to publish a public summary of all the reasons expressed by individual adults about why they are seeking transition care. Other proposed rules could directly impede access to care by mandating treatment from multiple, costly, and already difficult-to-access specific medical professionals. These new policies would mandate that to lawfully provide gender-affirming care to adults or minors, including even “diagnosis of a gender-related condition,” the patient must get in-person, direct services from a psychiatrist and an endocrinologist, and have a “written, comprehensive, multi-disciplinary care plan … which has been reviewed by a medical ethicist.” For many trans people in Ohio, this will be nearly impossible to obtain. It is a rule of exclusion.“The rules as written seem tailor-made to eliminate care from smaller clinics, and leave standing larger hospital networks,” Cam Ogden, a member of , told me this week. If these rules went into effect, Ogden said, “the clinic that I get my HRT from would not be able to meet these demands and would likely have to shut down their gender-affirming care provision.” While a number of pediatric hospitals in the state provide care involving the multidisciplinary teams the new rules would now require of adults, as Ogden explained, there are only so many. “If every single transgender person in the state is mandated to be a part of one of those teams, then we’re going to have to go out of state for care.”On Wednesday, the Ohio House of Representatives  to override DeWine’s veto of their initial bill banning gender-affirming care for minors, with a Senate vote expected later this month. But there is no indication that, if the veto override makes it through the legislature, DeWine would withdraw his proposed additional rules. These rules are, after all, mostly in excess and outside the scope of the ban. Meanwhile, the Ohio  and  are accepting public comment on these proposed rules. Typically, there would be hearings after public comment, said Dara Adkison of TransOhio, but these agency rules were introduced under an “emergency” clause. “There is no timeline,” she said. “We are not operating as normal.”As debate and adoption of these new restrictions on care will transpire outside the state legislature now, DeWine has also made the process even less accessible. “The rules being proposed are the most stringent rules currently under consideration anywhere in the United States, and would restrict gender-affirming care providers to a handful of university hospitals,” wrote Jess Kant, a social worker and trans health researcher, in a blog  detailing the rules process. “Is it disappointing to have to essentially fight this battle on multiple fronts? Yes,” Siobhan Boyd-Nelson, co–interim executive director of , told me this week. “Is it draining for our movement, our organization, and our community? Absolutely. Do I think that’s an accident? I do not.”Still, as both Boyd-Nelson and Adkison emphasized, their organizations are ready for that fight. These proposed rules governing gender-affirming care must be understood, like restrictions on providing abortion, as an attempt to narrow the conditions under which care can be lawfully provided. In abortion care, the direct parallel would be TRAP laws—or —which typically far exceed what is needed to safely provide care, by specifying the width of corridors or procedure rooms or requiring clinics to be within a set distance from a hospital. Some mandate that providers have qualifications or affiliations that are not medically necessary. All of this has the effect of limiting who can provide and who can get an abortion.Such restrictions on abortion and on gender-affirming care often originate with lawmakers who lack expertise on health care, who were prompted by Christian-right groups who oppose such health care as part of their effort to roll back rights for queer people, trans people, women, and all of the above. Ohio State Representative Gary Click, who first introduced the ban that became H.B. 68 and dubbed it the “” bill, was  in 2021 by the Christian-right group Center for Christian Virtue. Founded in an Ohio church the 1980s, the  has fought anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people at the city level, and headed the campaign for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in the state.In line with the broader post-Obergefell strategy from the Christian right, CCV has stepped up attacks on trans rights and trans people generally. The group’s policy director, in a 2021 sermon at an Ohio megachurch,  that adults were coercing children into gender-affirming care. Representative Click has himself  that young people are “groomed in school and other places” into being trans. He has also spread  about gender-affirming care and suicide risk, which he  he learned from CCV. “Representative Click actively chose to put forth legislation that will forcibly detransition all transgender minors in the state without talking to a single one,”  Cam Ogden, who is also one of his constituents. Ogden asked Click directly whether he had talked to any trans individuals when proposing this legislation. Click  that he had not.What has been made to look like a debate over health care provision to trans people is—and arguably was from the start—an attempt to make the rights of trans people debatable. “This is how they begin to roll back the progress that we’ve made,” said Boyd-Nelson from Equality Ohio. “And let’s be clear: We didn’t make all that much progress.”</p>

    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 11 Jan 2024 03:06:12 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that he would not stop Israel from forcibly removing Palestinians from Gaza if he is elected president.The Republican primary debate featured just DeSantis and Nikki Haley, and saw a shocking return to actual policy discussion. At one point, moderator Jake Tapper asked DeSantis if he supported the mass removal of Palestinians.“I am not going to tell [Israel] to do that,” DeSantis said. “But if they make the calculation that to avert a second Holocaust, they need to do that,” then he wouldn’t stop them.The word for the mass expulsion of an ethnic group is ethnic cleansing.DeSantis also said he did not believe in a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and Gaza, instead accusing “Palestinian Arabs” of refusing to recognize the existence of Israel. The Palestinian Authority does, in fact,  Israel.Israel, however, only seems open to a two-state solution if the second state is on an entirely . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition has reportedly been secretly speaking with the Democratic Republic of Congo about resettling thousands of Palestinians in the African nation. and his allies have repeatedly floated the idea of forcibly removing Palestinians, but the idea has been vehemently rejected by the international community.Israeli officials, however, have made it increasingly clear in recent days that their plan is to completely eliminate . Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said last week that a way to solve the war was to “encourage the voluntary migration of Gaza’s residents to countries that will agree to take in the refugees.”Separately, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir told reporters that the war was an “opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza.”</p>

    <h1>Biden Official Refuses to Answer Whether Israel Cutting Off Water Is a War Crime</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 21:11:23 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby refused to answer whether Israel cutting off Palestinians’ access to water is a war crime.During a press conference on Wednesday, Kirby was asked about the upcoming International Court of Justice case accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.South Africa brought the charges against Israel and, as proof of its case, submitted an  in December documenting Israeli war crimes as well as statements by various Israeli officials that it says proves “genocidal intent.” The ICJ will hear its first public hearing on the case on Thursday.Kirby—and the Biden administration writ large—have completely dismissed the case thus far. Kirby last week called it “meritless, counterproductive, and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever.”On Wednesday, however, Kirby was again asked about whether he had read the actual filing against Israel.“You dismissed a few days ago the case brought by South Africa against Israel at the ICJ. Did you read the indictment, and if you did, do you believe that cutting off water, electricity, and fuel from a civilian population does not constitute a war crime by itself?”“Yes I read the indictment,” Kirby replied angrily. “And as I said, we stand by what we said about this. We find it without merit. We find it counterproductive. And I’ll leave it there.” White House refuses to answer question if Israel cutting off water supply to Gaza’s civilian population is a war crime and says the International Court of Justice’s investigation to determine if it is a war crime is “meritless” and “counterproductive.” — Waleed Shahid 🪬 (@_waleedshahid) South Africa’s filing links to several reports of Israel cutting off water, electricity, fuel, and food supplies—all of which has been documented extensively in the media.In December, Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell warned that clean water is so hard to find that “children in Gaza have barely a drop to drink.” Public health officials have  raised “” over the lack of clean water and the outbreak of infectious diseases, including waterborne illnesses like cholera and typhoid.One in every 100 people in Gaza has been killed since October 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah. That’s nearly 23,000 people—and that’s the most conservative estimate. The nonprofit Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor puts the at nearly 30,000.</p>

    <h1>Fox News Offers Bonkers Proof of Why Taylor Swift Is a Psyop</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 20:43:12 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Taylor Swift, 12-time Grammy Award winner, Spotify’s most streamed artist in 2023, and Time Person of the Year, can add another line to her résumé: Democratic Party psyop. At least according to Fox News.Fox host Jesse Watters, and frequent  Fox contributor Stuart Kaplan, spent Tuesday evening musing that the Biden administration may have been behind Swift’s recent post encouraging people to register to vote.Right now, Fox is suggesting that Taylor Swift is a psyop because she posted a link to register voters. — Acyn (@Acyn) “When she posted the link to the Vote.org, like hundreds of thousands of young Taylor Swift fans all of a sudden registered to vote,” Watters began. “I wonder who got to her, from the White House or from wherever?” Kaplan went on to suggest that the administration had sought out Swift, “whether with [her] knowledge or without [her] knowledge,” to lend her 279 million Instagram followers for a “covert” get-out-the-vote initiative. Watters, of course, offered no pushback on the psyops narrative.For what it’s worth,  registered on Vote.org as a result of Swift’s Instagram post in September.It is hardly forbidden knowledge that the Democratic Party has made celebrity endorsements of its candidates part of its campaigning strategy. The 2020 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions were, to mixed reviews, studded with the stars of  and . But Swift, whose forays into activism have been mostly limited to anodyne denunciations of Tennessee Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn and the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturning abortion rights, and support for Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ rights, has not been outspoken in her support for Joe Biden ahead of the 2024 election.This, of course, has not stopped conservatives like Watters and Kaplan from indulging their  and their suspicion that her popularity among young people betrays, at best, a symptom of national decadence and impending decline and, at worst, a government conspiracy. This is not even the first time Swift has been accused of participating in psyops; the far-right provocateur  previously linked her to a “2024 voter operation for Democrats on abortion rights.”Swift is only the latest celebrity to incur the wrath of the right. It once famously harnessed outrage at Colin Kaepernick and made it into a foundational block of its brand of reaction. But the obsession with Swift, about as inoffensive a cultural figure as exists in the United States, may just be the strangest. Watters closed the segment by lamenting that he “now [knows] a lot more about Taylor Swift than [he] ever wanted to know,” but it’s clear that the right’s Swift-hatred is a product of its own making. As 2024 approaches, it’s yet to be seen whether this fixation will reap electoral rewards.</p>

    <h1>ADL Officially Admits It Counts Pro-Palestine Activism as Antisemitic</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 20:33:35 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Anti-Defamation League has made a startling confession: It is now including pro-Palestine marches in its count of antisemitic incidents in the United States.The ADL released its annual antisemitism report on Wednesday, announcing that there were a stunning 3,283 such incidents in 2023. That’s a 361 percent increase compared to the previous year, according to the organization, which noted the “American Jewish community is facing a threat level that’s now unprecedented in modern history.”The organization also stated that two-thirds of the total incidents could be “directly related to the Israel-Hamas war.”The ADL report was widely covered by mainstream outlets like CNN, NBC, and Axios, which simply took the organization’s word for the gigantic increase without actually checking the data behind the claim.Not all media outlets fumbled the ball, however. As  first noted, there’s one big problem with the numbers: The ADL admits in its own press release that it includes pro-Palestine rallies in its list of antisemitic incidents, even if these featured no overt hostility toward Jewish people. Any anti-Israel or anti-Zionist chants are enough for the ADL’s new definition of antisemitism.The report’s full list of antisemitic incidents isn’t public, but under the new definition, it could even count anti-Israel protests by Jewish activists as antisemitic. Many Jewish Americans have been at the  of the pro-Palestine protests over the last three months.The 2023 report includes a whopping 1,317 rallies in its list of antisemitic incidents, with no clear distinction between whether the rallies included antisemitic rhetoric or anti-Zionist chants and without regard for whether there were Jewish organizers or participants involved. In other words, the underlying data in support of this assertion is likely to be considerably inflated.Antisemitism is a real, and growing, problem—especially in the United States. But the ADL isn’t helping anyone when it defines a bomb threat at a synagogue and a  as equally antisemitic. The problems with ADL’s reporting methods have been obvious for some time to anyone paying close attention. As Eric Alterman wrote for , the ADL has, since its founding, repeatedly changed its counting method—and then followed these periodic rejiggerings with reports asserting massive increases in antisemitic incidents. Even more troubling, the organization habitually fails to make distinctions between the various antisemitic incidents it is tracking. Graffiti found on the walls of a college dorm gets lumped together with more deadly tragedies, such as the 2018 shooting at the  in Pittsburgh.The organization’s reporting has taken an even greater turn for the worse under chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt. In 2015, he began his leadership at the organization with a speech that made virtually no mention of the dangers of . And on Israel, Greenblatt in 2022 firmly announced: “Anti-Zionism is antisemitism, full stop.” In October, an ADL researcher  over Greenblatt’s condemnation of Jewish Americans protesting Israel’s war on Gaza. But the next month, Greenblatt only  on his position, when he said that pro-Palestine activism has “clarified and confirmed that fanatical anti-Zionism from the hard left is as dangerous to the Jewish community as rabid white supremacy from the extreme right.” Along the way, Greenblatt has demonstrated a hesitance to criticize one of the more appalling antisemites in public life: Elon Musk. The two men’s strange alliance has  from Greenblatt’s predecessor, Abe Foxman. All that to say, the ADL’s new counting method isn’t a huge surprise. But it sure is disappointing to see so many media outlets take the organization’s word at face value.</p>

    <h1>The Five Most Unhinged Moments at Republicans’ Hunter Biden Hearing</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 20:19:40 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The House tried to hold a  Wednesday on whether to hold  in contempt of Congress, but things went off the rails so quickly that not much actually got done.Instead, the members of the House Oversight Committee ended up taking wild swings at Biden—and at each other.Here are five of the craziest things that happened during the hearing.1. Nancy Mace said Hunter Biden has “no balls.”Things got off to a strong start when Huner Biden himself appeared unannounced at the hearing. For some reason, this set off South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace.“My first question is, who bribed Hunter Biden to be here today?” she .“Second question: You’re the epitome of white privilege. Coming into the Oversight Committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed. What are you afraid of? You have no balls to come up here today.”Mace: You're the epitome of white privilege, coming into the oversight committee, spitting in our face, You have no balls to come up here and -- Moskowitz: We can hear from Hunter Biden right nowMace: Are women allowed to speak?!? Hunter Biden should be arrested right here — Acyn (@Acyn) 2. Robert Garcia entered “dick pics” into the House record.Biden left the hearing soon after Mace’s rant. His exit coincided with Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s opening remarks, much to her frustration. But her Democratic colleague Robert Garcia had a pretty good explanation for why Biden might not want to be in the room.“I think it’s really interesting to hear the gentlelady from Georgia speak about Hunter Biden leaving, when she is the person that showed nude photos of Hunter Biden in this very committee room,” Garcia said. “Showing dick picks in this committee room of Hunter Biden!”During a House Oversight Committee hearing in July, Greene tried to claim that Biden had engaged in sex trafficking and had listed payments to sex workers as a tax write-off. To support her argument, she  poster-size prints of Biden’s nude photos, which she later also posted on X (then called Twitter) and  in her email newsletter to unsuspecting subscribers.Garcia: I think it's really interesting to hear the lady from Georgia speak about Hunter Biden leaving and she is the person that showed nude photos of hunter Biden in this very committee room showing dick pics in this committee room — Acyn (@Acyn) 3. Jamie Raskin called Marjorie Taylor Greene an “expert” in pornography.Representative Jamie Raskin also couldn’t resist a jab at Greene for sharing Biden’s nude photos. Greene asked to enter evidence into the record, and Raskin objected due to the fact that Democrats had not received advance copies of Greene’s information.“In the past, she’s displayed pornography. Are pornographic photos allowed to be displayed in this committee room?” Raskin asked.When Greene said it wasn’t pornography, Raskin clapped back, “OK, well, you’re the expert.”Raskin has previously criticized Greene for displaying Biden’s nudes during a hearing. In July, he  Oversight Chair James Comer of undermining the committee’s credibility by allowing Greene to show the photos, saying the committee had been “reduced to the level of a 1970s-era dime store peep show.”House Oversight erupts as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) asks to introduce evidence. REP. RASKIN (D): "In the past, she's displayed pornography. Are pornographic photos allowed to be displayed in this room?" MTG: "It's not pornography." RASKIN: "Ok well you're the expert." — Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) 4. Jared Moskowitz held up a photo of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.At one point, the committee had to take a break from the hearing. Representative Maxwell Frost said on X (formerly Twitter) the recess was because Greene was “being unhinged.” He did not provide further details on what that meant.Frost then shared a photo of Representative Jared Moskowitz holding up a poster-size picture of Donald Trump hugging convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.We had to pause committee because Marjorie Taylor Greene is being unhinged. While we wait,  is holding this up: — Maxwell Alejandro Frost (@MaxwellFrostFL) Trump was  on a recently released list of the disgraced financier’s known associates. Republicans have tied themselves into knots trying to  off of Trump and onto other names on the list. (Being named on the list is not proof of legal wrongdoing.)5. Republicans accidentally gave away their own game.Toward the end of the hearing, Moskowitz pointed out that if the issue is that Biden won’t testify, it could be easily resolved then and there. After all, Biden was at the hearing.But when Moskowitz asked for a show of hands from people who wanted to hear Biden’s testimony, almost no Republicans raised their hand.“I’m a visual learner,” Moskowitz quipped. “And the visual is clear. Nobody over there wants to hear from the witness.”“The majority of my colleagues over there, including the chairman, don’t want to hear from the witness with the American people watching.”Moskowitz: Let's vote. Let's take a vote. Who wants to hear from hunter right now today? Anyone? Come on. Who wants to hear from hunter? No one. So I'm a visual learner. And the visual is clear, nobody over there wants to hear from the witness. — Acyn (@Acyn) Biden has offered to  in a public hearing, but Comer rejected the offer almost immediately. He insisted Biden must first sit for a closed-door deposition,  Democrats. Raskin  Comer’s response in November as an “epic humiliation for our colleagues and … a frank confession that they are simply not interested in the facts and have no confidence in their own case or the ability of their own members to pursue it.”</p>

    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 17:02:03 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A Democratic representative skewered Republicans on Wednesday for seeking to penalize  for not responding to a congressional subpoena, when many members of the GOP have done much worse.The House Oversight Committee held a  on whether to hold Biden in contempt of Congress, after he refused to comply with a subpoena to sit for a closed-door deposition. Biden has offered to , but Republicans rejected his offer.Florida Democrat  tore into Republicans for wanting to hold Biden in contempt. “I’ll make this bipartisan. I’ll vote for the Hunter contempt today,” Moskowitz said. “You can get my vote, but I want you to show the American people that you’re serious.”Moskowitz then proceeded to enter into the record subpoenas for multiple Republican representatives to testify before the House January 6 investigative committee. As Moskowitz pointed out, Scott Perry, Mark Meadows, , Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs, and Kevin McCarthy all refused to appear before the committee.“There’s an amendment coming to add some of those names into the contempt order. You vote to add those names, and show the American people that we apply the law equally, not just when it’s Democrats,” Moskowitz said. “Show that you’re serious and that everyone is not above the law.”Moskowitz is very good at this. Here he is exposing GOP hypocrisy by brandishing all the subpoenas that Republicans recently refused to comply with. — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) Republicans, led by Oversight Chair James Comer, have insisted for months that Biden and his father, President Joe Biden, are guilty of corruption.

    <h1>Republican Rep. Melts Down After Realizing Hunter Biden Showed Up to Hearing</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 16:32:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Republican Representative Nancy Mace had a bit of a freak-out on Wednesday when she realized  had shown up to a congressional hearing about him.The House Oversight Committee held a hearing to hold the younger Biden in contempt of Congress for refusing a subpoena to sit for a closed-door deposition. Biden, when defying the subpoena, offered to  before the American people instead—likely so that his words wouldn’t be twisted by Republicans.Whatever concerns the president’s son may have harbored about his Republican inquisitors not treating him fairly were confirmed after Mace reacted to his presence by launching into a truly unhinged rant.“My first question is who bribed Hunter Biden to be here today?” the South Carolina representative began, implying that Biden may have been paid to attend a hearing about him.“Second question: You’re the epitome of white privilege. Coming into the Oversight Committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed. What are you afraid of? You have no balls to come up here today.”A fight soon broke out in the committee as Democratic Representative Moskowitz pointed out that if Mace wanted to hear from Biden, he could testify publicly.An outraged Mace began yelling back, “Are women allowed to speak in here or no?”“I think that Hunter Biden should be arrested right here and right now and go straight to jail,” she demanded.Mace: You're the epitome of white privilege, coming into the oversight committee, spitting in our face, You have no balls to come up here and -- Moskowitz: We can hear from Hunter Biden right nowMace: Are women allowed to speak?!? Hunter Biden should be arrested right here — Acyn (@Acyn) As a reminder: Mace often pretends to be a moderate, but she has a long record of being a dedicated Republican culture warrior. For example, while she publicly criticizes her party on abortion, she dutifully  that comes to the floor.She has also distinguished herself as someone , which may explain her wild rantings. Her internal staff handbook was leaked last year, revealing that Mace’s North Star is whatever gets her a media hit. In fact, one aide surmised that she probably voted to oust Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy for no real reason other than to go on television.Perhaps this newest meltdown is intended to get the attention of Donald Trump. After all, she’s  as his V.P.</p>

    <h1>Trump’s Idiot Lawyer Tries to Defend “Murdering Rivals Is OK” Argument</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 15:07:35 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong>  and his lawyers are presenting increasingly unhinged defenses of the former president’s claim that he should be immune from criminal proceedings, as his legal team appears to scramble to keep up the argument.Trump’s lawyers presented his case for immunity to a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, and to say it went badly for Trump’s team was an understatement. At one point, lawyer John Sauer  that a president could face criminal prosecution—say, for ordering Seal Team 6 to assassinate someone—only if he had been impeached and convicted first.Trump attorney Alina Habba, who seems to have a  of saying things that actually hurt Trump’s various legal cases, tried to defend Sauer’s defense that evening. She  that Judge Florence Pan, who asked about the Seal Team 6 assassination, was using “hypotheticals that do not currently exist.”“The real facts are so easy to win that we have to now argue the slippery slope argument of, ‘If he kills someone, will he be held accountable?’” Habba  on Fox News. “He didn’t kill anyone. He didn’t cause an insurrection. He didn’t get charged for it. But they’re using hypotheticals to frighten America.”Saying that Trump hasn’t killed anyone—but he has the right to get away with it as long as Congress doesn’t impeach him—is a terrible argument. Pan’s question, moreover, was intended to demonstrate that there are certain cases when a president does not have immunity from criminal prosecution.It’s also unclear what Habba meant when she said Trump “didn’t get charged for” causing an insurrection, because he has been—twice. Once when the House voted in January 2021 to impeach him for incitement of insurrection and again in August when special counsel Jack Smith  Trump for his role in the January 6 riot.Trump has repeatedly argued that former presidents can’t be criminally charged for actions related to their official responsibilities. He did not explain how overturning an election was related to official presidential duties.Despite insisting all day Tuesday that the immunity hearing had gone well, Trump launched into a  that evening, during which he presented some wild defenses of his own. First, he said that losing immunity would prevent a president from enjoying “HIS OR HER ‘GOLDEN YEARS’ OF RETIREMENT” because they would be bombarded with lawsuits.Then Trump said that if he lost immunity, then Joe Biden would too, hampering the latter’s ability to function as president. Finally, Trump said that losing immunity would mean “‘OPENING THE FLOODGATES’ TO PROSECUTING FORMER PRESIDENTS.”“AN OPPOSING HOSTILE PARTY WILL BE DOING IT FOR ANY REASON, ALL OF THE TIME!” he wrote on Truth Social.Trump, however, is the  to face this many lawsuits post-office, and the first to face  of this nature.</p>

    <h1>The Child Tax Credit Is Back From the Dead</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Two years after the expiration of the expanded child tax credit, a pandemic-era policy that  lowered child poverty rates, federal lawmakers are close to a bipartisan deal that may reinstate some version of the credit.Leaders of the tax-writing committees in the House and Senate are  to expand the existing child tax credit in exchange for extending certain business tax credits, including a popular credit related to research and development that expired at the end of 2022. Punchbowl News  that the tax deal on the table may end up in the $50 to $80 billion range. A source familiar with negotiations told me that the leaders of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee had not yet agreed to a final number, but that it would likely be a multiyear deal, rather than making the credits permanent.But the road ahead is anything but smooth, as this potential deal arises during a particularly busy and politically fraught legislative period. With so many other pressing agenda items currently under consideration in Congress—such as keeping the government funded—it is unclear whether this tax deal will be approved in a timely manner.Democrats have previously floated the idea of reinstating some version of the child tax credit that was temporarily expanded in 2021—and implementing it in concert with a credit related to business deductions for R&D expenses, a policy popular on both sides of the aisle. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, a Republican, launched negotiations last year. Wyden and Smith spoke with Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo about the proposal on Tuesday. The staff of the House Ways and Means Committee was also set to discuss the deal with Republican committee members on Wednesday.“We’ve already, I think, prevailed on a crucial issue, which is that there’s going to be equal treatment with working families and business,” Wyden told reporters on Tuesday. “I want to get as much help as possible for these working families, and get as many families out of poverty as we possibly can. That’s what the objective is, is reducing child poverty in America.”The version of the child tax credit agreed to in this potential deal will likely differ from the expansion implemented in the summer of 2021. That iteration of the credit was established by the American Rescue Plan Act, the nearly $2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation passed by Congress shortly after President Joe Biden took office. The expanded credit went into effect on July 15, 2021, with three fundamental changes to the preexisting policy. The amount of the credit increased to $3,000 for children between the ages of 6 and 18, and to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under, in households earning up to a certain threshold. It was also disbursed in monthly installments, rather than a lump sum issued during tax filing season—a move that helped poor Americans to address some of their most pressing financial needs, such as rent and food costs. The most significant change to the credit, however, was a provision commonly known as “full refundability,” which allowed parents who owed little or no income tax to receive the credit. Prior to the American Rescue Plan Act, the child tax credit was not fully available for households that had no or extremely low income.The full refundability provision was critical to the expanded credit’s success in lifting millions of children out of poverty. In December 2021, the final month that the credit was in effect,  were raised out of poverty; the following month, January 2022,  sank right back down. According to , child poverty  from 2021 to 2022, in large part due to the expiration of the enhanced credit. Had the credit been in place in 2022,  kept over five million children out of poverty and cut the child poverty rate nearly in half. (Still, although it reached millions of children in low-income households, , in part because they needed to register with the IRS to obtain it.)“In the end, the part of it that’s most important to me is full refundability, to try to make sure that the poorest kids who’ve been excluded from the credit benefit,” said Senator Michael Bennet, who is an advocate for expanding the child tax credit but not directly involved in the current negotiations. “I think there have been some promising discussions about it. We’re going to have to see what the details are.”The child tax credit has  a bipartisan priority. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the massive tax package signed into law by President Donald Trump,  of the child tax credit from $1,000 per year to $2,000 annually, and increased the amount refundable per child, although it fell short of full refundability.“The current law policy, which was created by Republicans in the 2017 tax law, is effectively 80 percent refundable—it’s $1,600 out of every $2,000 per child is refundable, whereas the Democratic policy is that all of it should be refundable,” said Andrew Lautz of the Bipartisan Policy Center. “It’s 80 percent versus 100 percent, not 0 percent versus 100 percent. And so, theoretically, that divide should not be difficult to bridge.”It’s unclear whether Republicans would consent to full refundability, which would functionally eliminate the earnings requirement for the credit. “Some of the things they asked for, they want to go back to pandemic levels [of spending], for example, they want full refundability. Those are really hard issues, and you’re not going to get Republicans to agree to a lot of that,” Senator John Thune, the minority whip and a Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee, told me. “I think their asks have to be reasonable, and there’s going to have to be a good balance between what they’re requesting and what Republicans are going to need.”Senator Thom Tillis, another GOP member of the Finance Committee, said that he believed Republicans and Democrats were still relatively far apart on the child tax credit. “There still seems to be a number of people on the other side of the aisle that believe the Covid-era policy should be codified. That’s just not going to happen,” said Tillis, echoing Thune. “Incidentally, even if there was support in the Senate, there’s no way that would pass the House.”Democrats on the Finance Committee indicated that while they would prefer a return to full refundability, they accepted the reality of needing to find a compromise. “I want to get whatever we can get. And we’re going to drive as hard a bargain as we can,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who has worked to expand the child tax credit, although he is not directly involved in current negotiations. Others were more skeptical. Representative Rosa DeLauro, who has advocated for an expanded child tax credit for several years, argued that the American Rescue Plan version was “our most effective tool in the fight against rising costs.”“I am concerned about the deal that is being negotiated, and am skeptical that any changes were necessary to improve the quantifiably successful child tax credit expansion that was included under the American Rescue Plan,” DeLauro said in a statement. “I believe that we need to extend that expanded, monthly child tax Credit as we knew it. I strongly believe anything less will fail to meet the moment.”Still, such a deal would also be a victory for Republicans; although the R&D credit is popular across the aisle, the business credits as a whole are particular priorities for the GOP. The 2017 tax law had included a provision requiring businesses to expense their R&D investments over five or 15 years, instead of immediately writing off the full amount. This policy, which began in 2022, has been universally loathed by the business community;  and the  are among those who have urged Congress to reinstate the ability to deduct R&D expenses annually.The deal would also likely bring back lapsed benefits for businesses deducting interest expenses and asset purchases. Beyond being a key Republican policy priority, approving business credits might be politically helpful for Johnson, the newly minted speaker, as a way to prove to the business community that he takes their concerns seriously.However, even if Democrats and Republicans were to reach an agreement, its future in Congress would be uncertain—in part because it may not include revenue raisers to accompany the tax cuts. Of course, supporters of both the child tax credit and business credits can argue that these policies will help the economy in the long term, but the cost may make some fiscal conservatives queasy. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  that, if made permanent, the policies under consideration could cost $830 billion over the next 10 years, with the business credits amounting for the majority of that cost. Just as pressing as the price tag is the functional question of procedure; not whether it can pass in Congress but how soon. Americans often begin the process of filing their taxes in January. If members of Congress want to pass legislation that expands the child tax credit retroactively—making it possible for parents to claim this year—they will need to do so quickly. Wyden told reporters on Tuesday that his goal was to finalize the legislation by January 29, when tax filing season formally kicks off. Crapo, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, indicated that he believed the conversations were serious. “I wouldn’t be working on it if it couldn’t become law,” he told HuffPost’s Arthur Delaney on Tuesday. “We have to put together a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that will be able to not only survive a filibuster, but survive the dynamics in the House.”Those dynamics can be complicated; Johnson is already facing pressure from his right flank on issues of government funding and immigration policy. Moreover, Smith’s committee is one of three spearheading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, although Wyden said that Smith’s role in those investigations has not factored into their negotiations on a tax deal.There is also the question of attaching the tax deal to a plausible legislative vehicle to allow for its quick passage. Funding for four government agencies expires on January 19, with the remaining eight funded through February 2. Although Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to a funding deal over the weekend, there is very little time to pass such massive spending legislation. Indeed, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Congress would need to pass a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government funded temporarily.Moreover, Johnson  from some of the more hard-line conservative members of the House angry that the spending deal matches the agreement reached by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Biden last spring. In theory, a tax deal including an expanded child tax credit and extended business credits could be added to such spending legislation; however, it’s uncertain whether such an addition would help or hinder the overall goal of averting a government shutdown. (Johnson had also painted himself into a corner by saying last year that he would not support another short-term continuing resolution.)When asked about a potential vehicle for a tax deal, Wyden compared the situation to the movie Field of Dreams. “If you build it, then everybody’s gonna show up,” he said, echoing the film’s famous tagline. “That’s not exactly how the Congress of the United States works, but we’re generating a lot of support right now.”</p>

    <h1>Bill Ackman’s Plagiarism Hypocrisy Is Stratospheric</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Bill Ackman, the hedge fund billionaire who helped chase Claudine Gay out of Harvard’s presidency, learned last week from Business Insider that his wife, former MIT professor Neri Oxman, has a  arguably worse than —because in addition to borrowings similar to those that sank Gay, Oxman’s dissertation , a source professors typically shoo undergraduates away from. Ackman is not taking this news well.I’ve  about Ackman’s oligarchic bullying and his brazen hypocrisy on the subject of antisemitism. Even as Ackman was  a bunch of teenagers whose Harvard student organization signed onto a foolish and offensive  about the October 7 Hamas massacre, Ackman was simultaneously  an  made by 53-year-old Elon Musk, the richest human on Planet Earth (net worth: ). The offending antisemitic tweet was , and it sent corporate advertisers leaving Twitter/X in droves. In a classic two-step maneuver characteristic of bullies, Ackman punched down and kissed up. Now Ackman has extended his hypocrisy into the realm of plagiarism, a project that includes bullying Axel Springer, the publisher of Business Insider, into investigating the ethics of its own scoop. His new campaign is more bizarre and potentially more dangerous.It would be inaccurate to say Ackman took the lead on publicizing plagiarism accusations against Gay; that role was assumed by the New York Post, the Free Beacon, a conservative activist named Christopher Rufo (himself guilty of  a Harvard credential in his bio), and a still-unidentified person who    with the Harvard Corporation between December 11 and January 1. Ackman’s initial beef with Gay concerned student protests over the conflict in Gaza. But Ackman  the  allegations  on Twitter well before the most damning evidence appeared, and he made them part of his brief against Gay in his unsuccessful attempt to get her fired in mid-December. As I’ve , Gay resigned in early January not because Harvard was unwilling to stand up to Ackman about student protests and diversity, equity, and inclusion (which eventually displaced the protests as Ackman’s chief bugbear), but rather because Gay’s plagiarism turned out to be much more serious than initially believed. After Oxman came under similar fire, Ackman abruptly and seemingly without embarrassment reversed his stance on plagiarism. Here’s what Ackman  on January 3, the day that Gay’s resignation was announced:When the Board finally publicly acknowledged some of Gay’s plagiarism, it characterized the plagiarism as “unintentional” and invented new euphemisms, i.e., “duplicative language” to describe plagiarism, a belittling of academic integrity that has caused grave damage to Harvard’s academic standards and credibility. I find nothing to quarrel with here. Even granting (as I do) that the initial plagiarism evidence against Gay was embarrassing rather than disqualifying, Harvard administrators’ initial attempt to excuse her “duplicative language” as unintentional was, indeed, absurd. Plagiarists always say they acted unintentionally. (Wouldn’t you?) Perhaps for this reason, the Modern Language Association, which I consider the last word on the subject,  that intentionality is irrelevant: Copying a published or unpub­lished text of any length, whether deliberately or accidentally [italics mine], is plagiarism if you don’t give credit to the source. Paraphrasing someone’s ideas or argu­ments or copying someone’s unique wording without giving proper credit is plagiarism. Similarly, Harvard’s online guide to using sources :Plagiarism is defined as the act of either intentionally OR unintentionally [italics mine] submitting work that was written by someone else. If you turn in a paper that was written by someone else, or if you turn in a paper in which you have included material from any source without citing that source, you have plagiarized.And, yes, it’s still plagiarism if you change a word here or there. Harvard calls that “.” Any student caught plagiarizing, says the online guide,  “subject to disciplinary action, up to and including requirement to withdraw from the College.” It’s different, of course, when grown-ups do the plagiarizing at Harvard. When I last looked into this two decades ago, America’s oldest university  who commit plagiarism much more gently than it did undergraduates. An  published anonymously in The Harvard Crimson a few days before Gay resigned persuaded me this double standard  (until widespread, deeply embarrassing public attention compelled Gay’s departure). Afterward, Ackman, (taking things too far, as usual)  on X that Harvard’s allowing Gay to return to her faculty position set a “bad precedent for academic integrity” because “students are forced to withdraw for much less.” That was January 3. On January 4, Ackman’s views on plagiarism took a 180-degree turn, prompted by Business Insider  that Mrs. Ackman had committed plagiarism in her doctoral thesis (“including at least one passage directly lifted from other writers without citation”). It wasn’t fair, Ackman wrote, because “as far [back] as I can remember in business and in media … .” Never mind that Neri Oxman is both a grown woman and a public figure. Also, Ackman said, it wasn’t fair because the editor of Business Insider’s investigative group “is a known anti-Zionist” and “.” For the record, I find no evidence that this editor, John Cook, is “anti-Zionist.” I suspect Ackman has him confused with a British reporter named  (who is also not, as far as I know, anti-Zionist). Also, Ackman wrote, it wasn’t fair because the lead Business Insider reporter, Katherine Long, sent an email to Ackman’s communications aide at 5:19 p.m. Friday, “after sundown on Friday night to a family that .” The email presented evidence of Oxman’s (again, especially mortifying) plagiarism of Wikipedia and asked for comment. Ackman didn’t state outright that he found a Shabbat email antisemitic, but he noted that Oxman is Israeli and invited readers to “” I thought about it. Scoops do not arrive on a convenient schedule; it’s imperative to move them quickly before someone else scoops you; and the roughly two hours Business Insider gave Oxman to respond is par for the course. Ackman also hinted darkly that somebody might have set up Oxman by rephrasing a Wikipedia entry to make it mimic Oxman’s writing (“”). Ackman hasn’t repeated this argument, possibly because somebody explained to him that Wikipedia records and dates every single change made to its content. (For those of you curious about the ins and outs of Wikipedia editing and the history of the site being plagiarized, Wikipedian and writer Molly White  in a YouTube video.)Finally, Ackman said, Oxman received “,” as if journalism adhered to judicial procedures, which it doesn’t.As for the plagiarism accusation itself, Ackman suddenly found that word to be entirely unacceptable … because Oxman’s plagiarism was not deliberate!“Plagiarism is fraud,” Ackman . “Plagiarism is a crime.” Oxman, he wrote,admitted to making four clerical errors of punctuation and one missed footnote in her 330-page dissertation, and she apologized for doing so. To this day, she has never admitted to plagiarism. She has never committed fraud of any kind.In a subsequent tweet Ackman  that MIT, where Oxman received her doctorate, “did not require citation or even mention Wikipedia until 2013, four years after Neri wrote her dissertation.” Mightn’t that be because using Wikipedia as a source for an academic paper was so obviously déclassé that before 2013 MIT couldn’t imagine anyone doing it?It’s tempting to laugh all this off, but when a transparently hypocritical and utterly misguided complaint about press coverage is attached to , which is Ackman’s net worth (according to Forbes), it’s going to make waves. Ackman’s complaint that Business Insider displayed anti-Zionist behavior hit a raw nerve at Axel Springer, a German company whose German employees are required to pledge fealty to Israel. (Yes, that’s overkill. There’s some  behind it.) In a public statement, Axel Springer  it would take “very seriously” allegations “about the motivation and the process leading up to the reporting.” According to Ackman, an Axel Springer director has already  “I agree with you” that plagiarism is defined too broadly.Meanwhile, Ackman, convinced that Business Insider obtained the plagiarism evidence on Oxman from someone at MIT, declared a sort of  against the university (whose president he was already trying to  for her congressional testimony about antisemitism on campus):Every faculty member knows that once their work is targeted by AI, they will be outed. No body of written work in academia can survive the power of AI searching for missing quotation marks, failures to paraphrase appropriately, and/or the failure to properly credit the work of others.Never mind that, one month before, Ackman argued that Claudine Gay’s plagiarism demanded attention because it represented an exceptional violation of academic standards. Now Ackman was saying, “They all do it,” and he meant to demonstrate that, not only at MIT but also at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and Dartmouth. Indeed, Ackman argued, “The most productive and important scholars” were the most vulnerable “because the more papers and pages you have written, the greater the probability that you missed a citation or some quotation marks.” By this logic, Harvard shouldn’t have accepted Gay’s resignation as president. It should have given her a raise.By now Ackman was edging close to an apology about Gay—not, I suspect, out of any sincere remorse but rather because even he was drifting toward some dim recognition that perhaps he was being a little hypocritical about plagiarism. Yes, Ackman , “I publicly questioned how the board could have approved her remaining on the faculty in light of the amount, nature, and degree of plagiarism that had surfaced in her work.” But “I was convinced by others more expert than I, that her academic oeuvre was not of sufficient scale or quality, and that the plagiarism issue was sufficiently troubling that she was not qualified” even to remain on Harvard’s faculty. Ackman was misled by academic experts!In retrospect, I shouldn’t have had to form my own conclusions about plagiarism in her work. That should have been determined in a formal and transparent process by an administrative board comprised of independent members who could have judged her work without personal consequences to themselves.Never mind that one month earlier Ackman was  that, rather than go through channels, the Harvard Corporation went “outside of the proper process” and assigned evaluation of the plagiarism allegations about Gay to “a “three-person panel of ‘political scientist experts’ that to this day remain unnamed” and therefore were free to judge “without personal consequences to themselves.”On what other Philistines does Ackman threaten, like Samson, to pull down the temple? On Monday, Ackman  to “pursue these societally important issues including problems with how our media operates”—reassuring his investors that this vendetta won’t interfere with his day job because “I am posting this while on the elliptical [trainer].” I look forward to my very own plagiarism check. After reading all these tweets I’m tempted to believe that Ackman is in the throes of some very public nervous breakdown, but having seen Donald Trump and Elon Musk behave similarly on social media, I know this is just something rich people do. </p>

    <h1>The Biden Administration Is Letting Corporate Criminals Off the Hook</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 10 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> 2023 was —and might be  we’ll experience for the rest of our lives. Along similar lines, U.S. agencies are perhaps as empowered as they ever will be to go after corporate polluters in 2024. The Supreme Court could soon delight right-wingers and their C-suite funders by  the so-called Chevron doctrine, which holds that courts defer to agency expertise in interpreting federal statutes. If they take the White House, Republicans promise to further weaken federal oversight by gutting protections for the environment and public health while decimating the civil service. But that hasn’t happened yet. So why is the Biden administration already letting so many corporate polluters off the hook? The Department of Justice prosecuted fewer corporations in fiscal year 2022 than at any point since 1994, per an  published by the watchdog group Public Citizen in October. The overwhelming majority of corporations it did prosecute (81 percent) had fewer than 50 employees, according to the department’s ; just 7 percent had more than 1,000. By its own estimation, enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency reduced, treated, or eliminated fewer pollutants than such efforts have at any point in the last decade. Also in fiscal year 2023, which started in October 2022, the EPA charged  than it has at any point in the last decade.The EPA did increase enforcement efforts last year, boasting a  uptick in criminal cases opened over the previous year, as well as a 30 percent increase in inspections; the EPA conducted more inspections last year than at any point since 2018. It demanded 57 percent more in penalties, fines, and restitution from violators than in the previous year. And the agency has also outpaced goals laid out in its  for 2022 through 2026, having conducted 60 percent of on-site inspections in environmental justice communities.The bar for improvement was shockingly low, though. In fiscal year 2022, EPA civil enforcement cases plummeted to their , according to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project. Jail time for criminal defendants reached an all-time low.  were opened in 2022 than at any point since 1992. An EPA spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.There’s plenty of blame to go around for the agency’s low enforcement numbers—much of which has nothing to do with the Biden administration. For two years, the Senate  Biden’s pick to head the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Assistant Administrator David Uhlmann. Congress has also largely declined to reverse longer-term funding shrinkage, which left the agency with a 2021 budget just  of what it had been 40 years prior, adjusted for inflation. Lawmakers agreed to a modest  boost in the EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2023, but it continues to fight an uphill battle against decades of attrition and cuts. While the agency bolstered its enforcement program with 300 additional staff last year, it has lost 950 staffers over the last decade. As of 2022, the agency’s civil enforcement had just two-thirds the staff it did in 2012, and its number of criminal enforcement agents had dropped by around 20 percent. The agency could lose even more personnel if Trump wins a second term in office. As Axios and Government Executive have , Trump’s aides are working on a radical plan to reclassify civil service positions as political appointees. (The Office of Personnel Management has  a rule to safeguard existing civil servants and protect them from political reprisals.)Tim Whitehouse, a former EPA enforcement attorney and the executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, praised the Biden administration’s recent improvements on enforcement while acknowledging the strong headwinds such efforts face. “It takes years of sustained funding and political support to build a good enforcement program,” he told me. “The instability in Congress is not only demoralizing to EPA staff but undermines their ability to think strategically over the long term.” The problems at the EPA are distinct but not unrelated to those at the Department of Justice, which handles environmental crimes via its , or ENRD. Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann—the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement—had served as the longtime head of that division’s Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which—as a relatively underfunded office—often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well. As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump’s EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average. The Department of Justice’s overall approach to corporate crimes has come under intense scrutiny from advocates. While watchdogs have lauded some steps the department has taken during Merrick Garland’s tenure as attorney general—like finally establishing a —Biden’s DOJ has also leaned heavily on leniency agreements that allow companies to defer or avoid prosecution, and encouraged companies to scapegoat individual employees so as to avoid a broader charge. Kenneth Polite Jr., former assistant attorney general for DOJ’s Criminal Division,  the division’s corporate enforcement policy so as to limit prosecutions. Last January, he declared thatif a company voluntarily self-discloses, fully cooperates, and timely and appropriately remediates, there is a presumption that we will decline to prosecute absent certain aggravating circumstances involving the seriousness of the offense or the nature of the offender.In the same speech, Polite added that “we will generally not require a corporate guilty plea—including for criminal recidivists.” He left the DOJ seven months later to join the law firm Sidley Austin’s private corporate defense practice. In response to criticisms in December that the department was being too lenient with corporate criminals, a DOJ spokesperson told The Washington Post that the department “is focused on the impact of our prosecutions, not just the number of them. We pour resources into bringing the most serious cases against the most significant wrongdoers.”Public Citizen Research Director Rick Claypool, who authored the report referenced above, argues that the DOJ’s current approach to corporate crime enforcement “avoids the deterrent effect of prosecuting corporations and the systemic reforms that happen as a result.” Those tracking both EPA and DOJ say the agencies seem reticent to take on big, risky cases. “EPA should not just be taking on cases that don’t result in strong political resistance, but taking cases that prevent the most public health harm,” Whitehouse said.The stakes of enforcement will get higher over the coming years. As billions of dollars in federal subsidies flow into fledgling technologies like hydrogen energy and carbon capture and storage via the Inflation Reduction Act, regulators have been eager to delegate oversight of new activities to states and . At the tail end of last year, for instance, the EPA  Louisiana’s  Department of Natural Resources the power to approve wells used to permanently sequester captured carbon in underground rock formation. The state has  of pending carbon capture projects, which can pose  if not properly built and maintained. Gulf Coast communities already grappling with polluting fossil fuel and petrochemical infrastructure are skeptical that Louisiana’s DNR will prioritize safety over corporate interests. “Given all that the federal government is doing with public money to support expanded industry down there, there has to be a counterbalance of aggressive enforcement and oversight of failing Louisiana agencies,” says EarthJustice President and environmental attorney Abigail Dillen. “For as long as I’ve been practicing law, I have yet to see EPA take back a program that’s been delegated to the state because the state is failing to live up to federal standards.”In the best of circumstances, that is, regulators charged with setting rules for potential growth industries are doing so with paltry staff and resources. It’s understandable why the administration might want to take some of the load off agencies already strapped for cash and staff, delegating more enforcement responsibilities to states and the private sector. But federal agencies’ shoddy track record at holding either corporate polluters or wayward state regulators accountable doesn’t inspire confidence in the regulation of these emerging and potentially hazardous technologies. Republicans are preparing to take a sledgehammer to an already beleaguered administrative state should they take the White House, Congress, or both in November. The Biden administration’s window for enforcing the country’s environmental protections is rapidly closing. Unfortunately, some federal agencies are acting like the GOP has already won.</p>

    <h1>Florida GOP Just Can’t Stop: New Bill Would Ban Virtually All Abortions</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 21:52:57 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A Florida Republican lawmaker has  a bill that would essentially ban abortions altogether, going even further than the already draconian restrictions on the procedure in the Sunshine State.State Representative David Borrero filed a  Monday that would ban anyone from performing an abortion except to save the patient’s life. There are no exceptions for rape, incest, or if the patient is a minor. The bill would establish that personhood exists from the moment of fertilization.The measure (H.B. 1519) states that a qualifying medical emergency would be “an emergent physical condition in which an abortion is necessary to preserve the life of a pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.” The bill makes no mention of what a patient should do if they miscarry and need to have the fetus removed, or if the fetus develops a fatal anomaly. Under the bill, “performing or attempting to perform an abortion” is classified as a third-degree felony. Doctors who conduct abortions for reasons other than those allowed by the measure could face up to 10 years in jail, up to $100,000 in fines, or both.The Florida Senate minority leader, Democrat Lauren Book, slammed the bill as a “desperate attempt at relevancy by the bill sponsor.”“We are in arm’s reach of getting abortion on the ballot and restoring the rights they stole,” she  the Sun Sentinel. “Republican leadership knows this is no longer a winning issue for their party. Voters of all political leanings have shown and will continue to show their overwhelming support for women’s right to healthcare privacy and reproductive freedom.”Florida currently bans abortion after 15 weeks. That law went before the state Supreme Court in September. If the court upholds the law, then an even more restrictive measure banning abortion at six weeks—before most people know they are pregnant—will go into effect. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis  the hugely unpopular bill in April.If Borrero’s bill becomes law—a possibility, with Republicans controlling both chambers of the state legislature and the governor’s office—then it would supersede the six-week ban.But there’s a chance that all of these laws will be defeated. Florida abortion advocates have collected  to put access to the procedure on the state’s . The amendment would allow abortion access up until viability, or when the fetus can survive outside the uterus. This is generally estimated to happen at around 24 weeks.The ballot initiative faces a major  challenge, though. State Attorney General Ashley Moody, a DeSantis ally, has  the Florida Supreme Court to disqualify the amendment. She argues the language is misleading, claiming that the use of the word “viability” could have multiple meanings. The state’s high court will hear arguments on February 7.</p>

    <h1>Here’s the List of Things Trump Can’t Say at the Next E. Jean Carroll Trial</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 20:03:29 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A federal judge on Tuesday  strict limitations on what Donald Trump and his attorneys can say during the former president’s upcoming trial for defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.Trump will go on trial starting next Tuesday for comments he made in 2019, when he said Carroll accused him of raping her just to promote her memoir. Presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan has already determined that Trump is liable for defamation, so the trial is primarily to set damages.Kaplan issued an order Tuesday barring Trump and his lawyers from discussing Carroll’s choice of lawyer or who might be paying her legal fees. They are prohibited from making comments “concerning Ms. Carroll’s past romantic relationships, sexual disposition, and prior sexual experiences,” and they cannot argue that Trump did not sexually abuse Carroll or act with actual malice when making his comments about her.Here's the list of what he can't offer as evidence, argument, or comments in the jury's presence. And while it's not everything Carroll's side wanted, it might finally convince Trump that his testifying would be a bad idea. 3/ — Lisa Rubin (@lawofruby) Trump’s legal team has argued that Carroll’s lawsuits are just another witch hunt against the former president. They claim her lawyer Roberta Kaplan (no relation to the judge) is biased because she has represented prominent Democrats, and that the whole lawsuit is being funded by a left-leaning billionaire.Judge Kaplan had already  over the weekend that Trump can’t argue he didn’t rape Carroll. Although Trump was found liable for sexual abuse, Kaplan has repeatedly  that Trump “‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’”In May, a jury unanimously  Trump liable for sexual abuse and battery against Carroll in the mid-1990s and for defaming her in 2022 while denying the assault. He was ordered to pay her  in damages.Kaplan ruled in September that since Trump has already been found liable for , his 2019 comments are by default . Carroll is now seeking up to $12 million in damages.Legal analyst Lisa Rubin noted Tuesday that Kaplan’s latest ruling might convince Trump not to testify in next week’s trial. Rubin  that Trump’s testimony could result in higher punitive damages, and he might violate the order while on the stand.Trump has already shown it will be difficult for him not to bring up Carroll’s past sexual experiences. Carroll wrote a popular sexual advice column in Elle magazine for nearly three decades. Just last week, over the span of about 30 minutes, Trump  31 posts about Carroll on Truth Social. Among the many things he shared were media interview clips and social media posts that appear to come from Carroll, all stripped of context so as to paint her as some sort of sexual deviant.</p>

    <h1>It Never Ends With the Freedom Caucus: Mike Johnson Ouster Countdown Begins</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 19:05:31 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Less than three months into Mike Johnson’s tenure as speaker of the House, some House Republicans are already experiencing buyer’s remorse.Texas Representative and Freedom Caucus member  on Monday publicly raised the possibility of dumping Johnson as speaker.Questioned by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Roy mentioned “colleagues that are really frustrated” with Johnson and alluded to “real conversations this week about what [House Republicans] need to do going forward,” calling the situation “[not] good.” Collins: Does that include potentially moving to oust Speaker Johnson from his job? Roy: Again, that's not the road I prefer… Collins: You said you don't prefer it, but you did not say no. — Acyn (@Acyn) And Roy is not alone. As Punchbowl News , some House Republicans have “significant concerns” about whether Johnson—the  speaker in 140 years—is “in over his head.” At least one Republican claimed Johnson is “getting rolled even more than [ousted former Speaker Kevin] McCarthy did.”Conservative dissatisfaction with Johnson stems from what some see as his acquiescence to President Biden and House Democrats on spending. Johnson over the weekend agreed to a $1.59 trillion spending deal for 2024. Under the deal, fiscal spending will be limited to what was mostly laid out in June’s Fiscal Responsibility Act, which averted a government shutdown at the time but also angered the Freedom Caucus and in part led to .In the  Johnson, Republicans like Roy saw a figure more amenable to their brand of austerity and obstructionism. Facing his first real test, however, Johnson seems to have failed in the eyes of some of his colleagues.Now concerns over Johnson’s ability to lead are trickling out via anonymous quotes from “” House members. Johnson’s rise from little-known Louisiana congressman to speaker of the House in the 23 days following McCarthy’s removal was seen as a win for the party’s right wing; Johnson’s  and social conservatism (he opposes  and  and sees his election as ) allowed anti-McCarthy holdouts to coalesce around his candidacy. But the one-member threshold for vacating a House speaker, which McCarthy implemented and which led to his own ousting, is still in place.And now, it seems Johnson’s days as speaker may be numbered.</p>

    <h1>Trump’s Idiot Lawyer Just Blew Up His Own Absolute Immunity Argument</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 18:36:35 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> One of Donald Trump’s lawyers on Tuesday made a shocking new defense of “presidential immunity”—and in the process accidentally destroyed one of the former president’s arguments for why he shouldn’t be charged for his role in the January 6 insurrection. has repeatedly insisted that he cannot be prosecuted for trying to overturn the 2020 election, because he has presidential immunity from criminal proceedings. His lawyers presented his case to a panel of three appellate judges in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.At one point, Judge Florence Pan asked if a president would be immune from criminal prosecution if he had ordered Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival. She noted that an order to Seal Team 6 would be an official act.Trump’s lawyer John Sauer said the president could be prosecuted, but only if he had been impeached and convicted first.That’s a terrifying interpretation on its own, but Pan took it one step further. She pointed out that this would mean presidents can be criminally prosecuted under certain circumstances. In other words, Trump does not have absolute immunity.“Doesn’t that narrow the issues before us to…‘can a president be prosecuted without first being impeached and convicted?’” Pan said. “All of your other arguments seem to fall away.”“Once you concede that there’s not this absolute immunity, that the judiciary can hear criminal prosecutions under any circumstances—you’re saying there’s one specific circumstance—then that means that there isn’t this absolute immunity that you claim.”CLIP: Exchange on immunity between DC Circuit Court Judge Florence Pan and D. John Sauer, attorney for former President Donald Trump.Judge Pan: "Once you concede that presidents can be prosecuted under some circumstances your separation of powers argument falls away..." — CSPAN (@cspan) Pan also  that Trump appeared to be trying to have it both ways. During his second impeachment trial, Trump and some of his Republican allies argued that the Senate shouldn’t convict him because he would face criminal prosecution later. But now, he claims he shouldn’t have to face prosecution, either.If the appellate judges rule against Trump, then the case will likely head to the . This could delay , which is currently set to begin on March 4, the day before Super Tuesday.Trump was  in August for his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection and other attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He faces one count each of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to corruptly obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against the right to vote.Trump has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and has insisted the case should be dismissed altogether. He argues that former presidents can’t be criminally charged for actions related to their official responsibilities. He did not explain how overturning an election was related to official presidential duties.While many critics say Trump’s immunity claim is a desperate attempt to avoid accountability, it could also be an attempt to ease his path towards . As Greg Sargent writes for , “If he wins on this front, he’d be largely unshackled in a second presidential term, free to pursue all manner of corrupt designs with little fear of legal consequences after leaving office again.”</p>

    <h1>How Trump’s Unhinged Immunity Demand Could Unleash a Second-Term Crime Spree</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 17:10:52 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Donald Trump and his lawyers are making an extraordinary demand in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals: They  from criminal charges related to his subversion of the 2020 election, because the actions were undertaken while he still occupied the White House.This has been widely depicted as a Hail Mary effort to scuttle special counsel Jack Smith’s  for conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding of Congress’s count of presidential electors—otherwise known for nearly 250 years in this country as the peaceful transfer of power.But there’s another way to understand Trump’s move: It’s about what comes next. If he wins on this front, he’d be largely unshackled in a second presidential term, free to pursue all manner of corrupt designs with little fear of legal consequences after leaving office again.That Trump might attempt such moves is not idle speculation. He’s telling us so himself. He is openly threatening a range of second-term actions—such as prosecuting political enemies with zero basis in evidence—that would almost certainly strain the boundaries of the law in ugly new ways.Now imagine him pursuing this project with a get-out-of-prosecution-free card in his pocket. “It really would permit him to be completely unconstrained if he were reelected,” Neil Eggleston, who served as White House counsel under President Barack Obama, told me.To be sure, Trump has a weak case, as  . The Justice Department has a long-standing policy against prosecuting sitting presidents, and the ex-president’s lawyers cite  to claim that  the “outer perimeter” of presidential duties, and thus immune from criminal prosecution after he left office. If not, , future presidents will be constrained in office by fear of nakedly political prosecutions later.But  that presidents do not “operate in a realm without law,” that granting Trump’s request would “license presidents to commit crimes,” and that his criminal efforts to overthrow democracy don’t fall within the “outer perimeter of official presidential responsibilities” to begin with.Smith is . The three-judge panel includes Michelle Childs and Florence Pan (appointed by President Biden) and Karen Henderson (appointed by President George H.W. Bush). So it doesn’t appear to be a Trump-friendly panel. But what if the court does side with Trump?It’s been said on social media that if Trump wins here, his second-term powers would be quasi-absolute—that he could order, say, the assassination of political foes with impunity. That overstates the matter. As former White House lawyers told me, if Trump prevails, the courts will likely affirm that actions within the “outer realm” of official duties are immune to prosecution, not that any actions (such as assassinations) are.But a favorable decision could still unshackle Trump in a big way. Trevor Morrison, associate White House counsel under Obama, says the key is whether the courts rule that Trump has immunity on the theory that his alleged criminal conduct does fall in the outer perimeter of presidential duties—and how the courts define that perimeter. If they accept Trump’s broad version of immunity or something like it, he might argue that future potentially criminal acts also fall within that perimeter.For instance, could a victorious President Trump urge the FBI to investigate Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis, who has also , and order the seizure of documents related to those charges to sabotage her effort? That would be similar to Trump’s  to fabricate a pretext for halting the January 6, 2021, electoral count.Or in the 2026 battle over the Senate, could President Trump threaten elections officials with prosecution while pressuring them to “find” votes in a decisive contest? After all,  with the Georgia secretary of state.Trump justified his pressure on Justice Department officials and Georgia’s secretary of state by claiming he was combating corruption. If Trump wins now, it might give him room to claim later that turning loose the FBI on Willis or pressuring elections officials in 2026 also constitute carrying out presidential duties to fight corruption, Morrison noted.“If he is found immune from these charges, there is at least a great risk that the courts will have endorsed an immunity that could cover a number of otherwise criminal things the president might do in the future,” Morrison said. Similarly, Cardozo Law School professor Kate Shaw  could encourage him to abuse his powers to purge the civil service and invoke the Insurrection Act to target all manner of domestic enemies.Kristy Parker, counsel at Protect Democracy who served as a lawyer in multiple administrations, notes that Trump has signaled clear intent to do exactly this sort of thing. He has  of him as corrupt,  of “vermin” Americans who oppose him, and  President Biden as retribution. “If I don’t get immunity, then Crooked Joe Biden doesn’t get immunity,” Trump .In saying this, Trump essentially declared that if he is denied immunity, he will prosecute Biden on a fake finding of corruption, just as he invented corruption as a pretext for his alleged election crimes. What happens if those efforts to name and target fabricated corruption are in some sense deemed official acts?“Trump has threatened to use the presidency to punish enemies, reward friends, and protect himself,” Parker told me. “If the courts recognize immunity for the broad array of official acts of the presidency, that will incentivize Trump to abuse those powers further.”Parker doubts the courts will side with Trump. “But the very nature of his claim further underscores his extreme view of the presidency as being completely above the law,” Parker said.There’s a strange tendency in our “LOL nothing matters” discourse to treat Trump as fearless and invulnerable in his corruption and (alleged) lawbreaking. In reality, Trump fears prosecution and accountability. As special counsel Robert Mueller’s  documented, he  that possibility, bullying his attorney general, trying to get Mueller fired, and ordering an underling to deny that effort.He was so eager to avoid legal consequences that he  to avoid it. These fears didn’t stop him from transforming his first term into an extraordinary spree of , , and , including trying to destroy lawful constitutional democracy, but he and  have taken extensive steps to  throughout.It’s sobering to imagine what Trump might be capable of during a second term—if it’s decisively confirmed to his satisfaction that the law will not apply to him after all.</p>

    <h1>Gee, Guess What Twitter Just Did to Accounts Critical of Elon Musk?</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 16:54:38 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> X, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday temporarily suspended the accounts of multiple prominent journalists and left-leaning commentators and comedians, many of whom were critical of X owner .The social media platform gave no explanation for the sudden purge, saying only that the accounts “violate the X rules.” The  prohibit violent or hateful speech, child exploitation, private information sharing, and fake information.But the accounts in question do not post that kind of content. The reporters who were banned include Steven Monacelli, a journalist at the Texas Observer who covers extremism, and Ken Klippenstein, who covers national security for The Intercept. Last year, Klippenstein published a  on the errors with Tesla’s self-driving feature, and Monacelli noted that X  the Intercept author since then. MintPress News reporter Alan MacLeod, who recently has extensively covered Israel’s approach to the war in Gaza, and leftist podcaster Rob Rousseau were also suspended Tuesday.They also got zei squirrel and Liam Nissan, both shit posting accounts that were critical of Elon and Bill Ackman. — Alejandra Caraballo (@Esqueer_) The accounts for @liamnissan, @zei_squirrel, and the TrueAnon podcast were suspended, as well. The @liamnissan account posts mostly comedic commentary, including criticisms of Musk. The TrueAnon podcast provides left-wing analysis of current political events and conspiracy theories.The @zei_squirrel account is another left-leaning commentator who has been critical of Musk in the past. In a post on their Substack Tuesday, the @zei_squirrel writer  that they had recently begun to criticize , a hedge fund billionaire and friend of Musk’s who helped lead the campaign against former Harvard University President . Ackman’s wife was recently  of plagiarism, the same charge that brought down Gay.All of the suspended accounts were reinstated a few hours later, but initially with significantly lower follower counts than before.This is at least the fifth time that X, under Musk, has purged accounts that are the slightest bit critical of him, his friends, or causes he supports. Shortly after taking the social network’s reins in October 2022, the self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist”  the accounts of multiple actors and comedians who made fun of him.Just a month later, accounts for people including Dean Baker, the senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and Andrew Lawrence, deputy director of rapid response at the left-wing watchdog Media Matters, were temporarily . Both men have been critical of Musk. Also that month, the accounts for several high-profile journalists including Keith Olbermann, Aaron Rupar, Ryan Mac, and Drew Harwell were temporarily .Dell Cameron, a reporter for Wired, was  in April last year for reporting on the hacker who targeted far-right commentator . Ironically, if X wants to ban an account that violates platform rules, the company need look no further than its owner. Musk’s personal account is a major source of hate speech and disinformation. In addition to aggressively , Musk also regularly lets  back on X, shares  content, and  conspiracy theories.This article has been updated.</p>

    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 15:16:51 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Explosive new audio of  reveals the longtime Trump ally was trying to plot the assassinations of two outspoken Democratic congressmen.A few weeks before the 2020 election, Stone told a member of his security detail that he wanted either Representative Eric Swalwell or Representative Jerry Nadler (or both) killed, according to audio obtained by . At the time, Nadler had just announced that the House Judiciary Committee, on which he and Swalwell serve, would investigate Trump’s decision to commute Stone’s sentence for .“It’s time to do it,” Stone  Sal Greco, then a member of the NYPD who was working as Stone’s security. “Let’s go find Swalwell. It’s time to do it. Then we’ll see how brave the rest of them are. It’s time to do it. It’s either Nadler or Swalwell has to die before the election. They need to get the message. Let’s go find Swalwell and get this over with. I’m just not putting up with this shit anymore.”A source familiar with the conversation, speaking anonymously, told Mediaite they believed Stone was serious. “Stone had been at war with Nadler and Swalwell for years. He just hates them,” the source . “He just wanted to get Trump back into office so these things would stop.”Stone, a notorious conservative political operative, has long been a loyal Trump adviser and ally. Video footage released in August revealed that Stone began  to overturn the 2020 election at least as early as November 5—two days before the vote had been called.And Stone has been rewarded over the years for his loyalty. Stone was  in July 2019 in relation to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. Stone was  of lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction of a proceeding.Prosecutors wanted Stone to be sentenced to nine years in prison, but Trump’s Justice Department reportedly  to give him a shorter sentence. Then, just days before Stone was due to go to jail, Trump commuted his sentence entirely. Nadler  the House Judiciary investigation into the commutation just a few days later.Four of the prosecutors abruptly  the case following the Justice Department’s intervention. At least one, Aaron Zelinsky, acknowledged he had left in protest. A separate audio recording revealed Stone wanted retribution against Zelinsky, as well.“He needs to be punished,” Stone  Greco, who has not worked with the NYPD since August 2022. “You have to abduct him and punish him.”Stone denied making the comments about Zelinsky, Swalwell, or Nadler and said the audio had been made with artificial intelligence.</p>

    <h1>Democrats Can’t Keep Ignoring Covid in 2024</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> My holiday experience probably resembled that of many others: waiting in line at the airport, listening to the hacks of people coughing all around me, mostly unmasked. The cognitive dissonance feels hard to overstate. We are still officially in a pandemic, even now, four years since the novel coronavirus first emerged. We know that Covid-19 is airborne and that wearing a mask is the most effective way to prevent airborne particles from being transmitted. We know that 1,600 people a week are currently dying from Covid-19 (and more than 2,000 last week), and that it’s no ordinary flu, with tens of millions of Americans and counting experiencing long-term debilitating symptoms. Despite all we could have learned about how a broken system left us vulnerable to this virus, despite the clear fixes that might protect us against future calamity, and despite the sense of solidarity toward helping others stay well that accompanied the early pandemic, it feels as though we’ve learned nothing from the experience. The dissonance perhaps hits harder for me, because I’ve struggled with long Covid symptoms for over three and a half years, as I first recounted in The New Republic in June 2020, in an article naïvely titled, “” Today, symptoms like exercise intolerance, tingling, circulation problems, overactive allergic responses, and shortness of breath have persisted. Though I’m able to manage most of my symptoms through a combination of about 15 daily medications and supplements, physical therapy, and avoiding strenuous activities, my quality of life and ability to work have diminished greatly. (And I’m far better off than some long Covid patients, who are bedbound.) I don’t have the luxury of ignoring Covid, as much of society has, following the lead of the Biden administration, which pledged to take a different approach than his predecessor did. This didn’t have to be an all-or-nothing choice. By framing Covid precautions as either “lockdown” or “a free for all,” the Biden administration has missed an opportunity to better protect its citizens and send clearer messages around Covid and the risk of long Covid, and promote the kind of commonsense mitigations that create no significant disruptions to “normal” life. With the 2024 election coming up, it must do better.Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped counting Covid-19 cases, according to wastewater data—which emerged early on as an accurate tracker of the ebbs and flows of the virus—we are currently in  of the pandemic, amid the spread of a new variant, JN-1, as the virus keeps mutating. More than  are currently in use due to Covid hospitalizations. Uptake of the most recent booster shot, which should help to protect against the new variant and lower the risk of severe cases and the odds of getting long Covid,   Meanwhile, the most recent White House response to a question about whether they had any guidance for hospitals, some of which have brought back mitigation protocols in response to the most recent Covid spike, came courtesy of : “Hospitals, communities, states, they have to make their own decisions. That’s not something we get involved in,” she replied, appearing exasperated. “We are in possibly the second-biggest surge of the pandemic if you look at wastewater levels,” said Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, who runs a long-Covid clinic at the University of Texas, San Antonio, and has had ongoing Covid symptoms since August 2022. “There is no urgency to this. No news. No discussion in Congress. There is no education.”In the first few years of the pandemic, concern over the transmission and mitigation of Covid fell on largely partisan lines. When Joe Biden entered office in January 2021, he promised to “follow science,” unlike the disastrous, delayed, and dangerous approach to the pandemic led by his predecessor, Donald Trump. For a while, things were looking up, with effective vaccines available for free to the public and interventions like Paxlovid becoming available. Biden promoted new initiatives and supported funding for Covid research and . Unfortunately, today, funding is drying up. Republicans are determined to block anything that looks like new spending on Covid; Democrats are seemingly content to let this antisocial stance slide.“[Biden’s] administration has the potential to lead a robust and inclusive response to the pandemic,” said Cynthia Adinig, who has suffered from long Covid since March 2020 and has since become a prominent expert and patient advocate with the. “However, in the last year of his administration there still remains much need for improvement.”Since the Biden administration declared the end of the national emergency in May, Americans across the political spectrum have largely followed the example set by the government and entirely disposed of any level of Covid precautions. Liberal and left-wing outlets have participated in the normalizing of Covid too, dismissing or even ostracizing people who still take precautions as if they are tin-hat conspiracy theorists. “We can’t be in lockdown forever,” has become a common refrain, as if wearing a mask on the subway constitutes “lockdown.” In September, Biden himself participated in the spread of this kind of harmful disinformation when he declared the pandemic “over” on 60 Minutes. “If you notice, no one’s wearing masks,” . “Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.” This is, essentially, governing via “vibes”—so much for “following the science.” And while the administration heavily encouraged vaccination in spring 2021,  due to sparse, muddled, and unclear messaging about how vaccination can  and serious cases. Moreover,  has made access to new vaccines more complicated and costly.The administration could have set in place permanent measures to protect Americans from Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases, such as normalizing staying home and wearing a mask when sick or in congested areas, ensuring regular vaccination, investing in HEPA air filtration in public spaces, making Covid testing more readily available, conducting contact tracing, and continuing to track Covid rates so that the public could be well advised of periodic spikes. It could have pressured airlines, who tacitly , to waive cancellation and change fees in cases where the choice is spreading Covid through the friendly skies or giving customers a chance to simply rearrange their travel.By ignoring Covid, Democrats are abandoning the over , as well as the swaths of people getting mysteriously ill more and more often, especially those in settings such as schools and hospitals, as well as the some 25 percent of our population who are disabled—a number that has since the pandemic began. It’s also a population that’s constantly in flux. As Tom Scocca recently wrote in a New York piece describing , “The able and the disabled aren’t two different kinds of people but the same people at different times.”  As Adinig said, “I don’t think Democrats in office fully understand the longstanding ripple effects of the pandemic. These issues are being pushed to the side in hopes they will go away on their own or be someone else’s problem later.” The consequences of discarding all Covid precautions are becoming clearer, as more people get repeated infections and long-term symptoms, amid an alarming spike in . People are getting sick more often not due to the myth of “immunity debt,” which posits that the lack of exposure to other people during lockdown has made people less able to fight off infections (three years later), but because Covid . Each time someone contracts Covid, the odds of long-term complications  Absenteeism in schools is on the rise, with . A recent study found that the risk of long Covid for children is 16 percent after just one infection. Adinig, whose son has long Covid, is passionate about the need to educate parents more about the risk of long Covid in children and measures like air filtration that could better protect them at school. Gwendolyn Hill, a previously healthy UCLA student, got long Covid from her third infection in June 2023. Now she can hardly walk the 15 minutes from her apartment to campus. She never expected it to happen to her, she told me in September. “If you do not have long-standing health issues and you have access to health care typically, then there is a lot of invincibility complex that comes into play.”The impulse to ignore or downplay Covid is understandable. It’s unpleasant, scary, and inconvenient to think about. “As a society, people are intentionally putting themselves as far away from any Covid-speak as possible so they can live in their delusional wall that everything’s OK,” Adinig told me last fall. “People in general have forgotten what it means to stay home from work or wear high-quality masks when they’re sick (with anything),” Verduzco-Gutierrez added. But this has consequences: “We’re going to have continued spread of the virus and sequela related to long Covid. This is going to be a large cost burden to society in the long run, and this is something that Congress has to realize,” she said.The normalization of Covid reinfections has made talking about the pandemic, or, God forbid, taking precautions, feel like a social taboo, making it increasingly difficult to expect or ask for any level of mitigations in work and social settings. As  in her excellent Substack post in December, “The political project of normalizing transmitting COVID and casting basic, scientific mitigations as bad, weird, mean, stupid, and impossible is a fantastic coup for the right.” In 2024, there must be more pressure on Democrats to support commonsense public health measures to prevent Covid and the future wave of zoonotic diseases that are likely to be unleashed by climate change. If the left wants to win, this election year and beyond, they need to set themselves apart from Republicans in their stance on Covid, modeling themselves as supporters of science and public health. It is not only a public health issue but a class issue, with ramifications for health care at large and the overall well-being of society. It has been disheartening to see  of Congress fail to speak out on behalf of those suffering from long Covid, especially when its impacts are so closely related to economic, social, and racial justice.Democrats could model commonsense Covid precautions and champion some of the positive—and popular—policies that accompanied the early pandemic, such as mandated sick pay, which wouldn’t force workers into the difficult position of working while sick and transmitting Covid or losing pay or even their jobs. Such issues are compounded for uninsured, underinsured, low-income workers and people of color, particularly as the cost of living rises and . Thanks no doubt in part to Republicans who politicized mask-wearing so much in the early pandemic, Democrats in government have hesitated to mention the dreaded m-word. But they could easily advocate for a harm-reduction approach to face coverings, modeling wearing masks in crowded indoor settings and public transportation, showing that masking in many high-risk settings is possible without disrupting social life. Of course, with their thin majorities and limits due to filibuster rules, Democrats are hamstrung in some ways on a legislative level to pass critical funding for Covid and long-Covid research, prevention, and trials, Adinig pointed out. “The lack of funding for these policy changes, essential for tackling the pandemic effectively, is a substantial obstacle.” But Democrats could—and should—fight harder instead of cowing to Republicans. Indeed, recent pressure at the local level in many states has resulted in the .A huge missed opportunity too lies in air filtration efforts, which could protect children in schools and others in health care and other crowded settings without being “obtrusive,” as Adinig put it. Focus on this must be amplified as a sustainable long-term intervention to protect ourselves and others, not only from Covid but from other viruses and poor air quality. Yet students and parents have resorted to , in the absence of legislation or more funding to keep kids safe at school.The shadow of the pandemic, whether we like it or not, still hangs over us. By deluding ourselves into pretending nothing is wrong, we’re playing roulette with our own lives and with each other, and allowing new variants to develop more frequently. Our response to Covid mitigation doesn’t have to be all or nothing, but even basic interventions are now being dismissed on both sides of the aisle. Joe Biden said it wouldn’t be like this. And yet, what we’re seeing today feels scarcely different from the denialism and diminishment of far-right Trump-ites who once laughed at our masks. Are we content to stand among their ranks?</p>

    <h1>There’s a Plausible Day-After Plan, but Don’t Tell Netanyahu</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> As the war on Gaza reaches its third month without Israel accomplishing its publicly stated goals, the discussion has begun to shift to finding an acceptable formula for what happens when the war ends.Israel’s two publicly stated goals were crushing Hamas and securing the safe return of the hostages. Clearly, Hamas has not been defeated as Israelis in Tel Aviv and other cities trying to celebrate New Year’s Eve were hit with a barrage of Hamas rockets at the stroke of midnight, some coming from northern Gaza, an area that the Israeli army has repeatedly claimed it controls. (The Iron Dome intercepted most of the missiles, and there were no casualties.)The other goal was partially accomplished but only as part of  with Hamas. Israeli civilians were exchanged with Palestinian women and youth in Israeli prisons, most of them held administratively without charges or trial under Israeli laws that date back to British Mandate  in 1945. Hamas agreed to release the civilian prisoners at a ratio of one Israeli to three Palestinians. However, the exchanges have stopped as Hamas, negotiating through Egypt and Qatar mediators, seeks a full cease-fire and an end to the Israeli occupation of Gaza. Hamas is  a formula of all versus all, meaning all Israelis held by Hamas (including civilians, soldiers, officers, and bodies of Israelis) in return for all Palestinians held by Israel, including the more than 4,600 detained without trial since October 7 and the  the Israelis have been holding for some time. The Hamas offer is conditional on an overall deal that includes a full-fledged cease-fire and an end to the occupation because Hamas is concerned that once Israel gets its civilians and soldiers, it will move even more brutally against Gaza in an attempt to accomplish its first goal.This is where things stand today because there is a big question mark as to what happens the day after Israel withdraws from Gaza. The problem is that there is a big gap between what is logical and possible and has international support and what Israel wants. The Netanyahu government does not want any solution that includes a role for the West Bank Palestinian leadership, nor does it agree to a solution where Gaza and the West Bank are ruled by any party. On the other hand, no Arab government is willing to bypass the government headed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, nor will any international body be willing to govern Gaza without the consent of the only party that has executive and security power in Gaza, namely Hamas and other militant groups.The United States and other international officials have floated the name of former Palestinian Prime  as a possible compromise solution. But Fayyad, currently a professor at Princeton University, told me that he has nothing to do with the ongoing discussions. Fayyad said that he insists on what he  that the day-after solution in Gaza must not be an isolated solution outside the legitimate, internationally recognized leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. He also believes that the PLO must be expanded to include representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. He told me that anyone governing Gaza needs to have the widest consensus of the various political/military powers of the Palestinian people. He knows that this idea might be anathema to Israel and maybe the U.S., but he is confident that they will come around to accept it because everyone wants the day-after solution to be represented by a broad leadership, and this requires a consensus of the powers on the ground. While these discussions have been going on behind the scenes in the Egyptian and Qatari capitals, Israel threw a monkey wrench in the discussions by a targeted assassination of senior Hamas leaders who were visiting the Hezbollah movement in Beirut. The  that killed Hamas’s number two man, Saleh Al Arouri, and four other Hamas leaders caused a suspension by Hamas of all negotiations. Palestinians in the West Bank declared a one-day business strike on January 3 to protest the killing of Al Arouri, who is originally from the West Bank.Not only did the Al Arouri assassination put a temporary end to the talks, but it is also bound to cause a delay in some of the behind-the-scenes attempts to reach some type of understanding between the PLO’s dominant group, Fatah, and Hamas. Jibril Rajoub, the secretary of Fatah, was authorized by Abbas to negotiate with Hamas on a deal that would allow Hamas to join the PLO. The lead person from Hamas who was holding the talks was the now-assassinated Al Arouri. Rajoub and Al Arouri were former prison friends and had established a good relationship that included both making positive public statements about each other.What has made this Hamas-Fatah rapprochement possible was the decision by Hamas to accept a long-standing condition that Abbas had demanded of them—that they accept all relevant international covenants. Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk suggested in mid-December that Hamas could adhere to the PLO’s position on Israel, which includes recognition of Israel. This acceptance was meant to legitimize the movement within international bodies and will indirectly include the recognition of Israel. The PLO and Israel had recognized each other on the eve of the signing of the Declaration of Principles at the White House on September 13, 1993.Top Hamas officials have  they accept all relevant international covenants and resolutions, thus opening up discussion that Hamas is willing to recognize Israel. It might be argued that such statements have been made under the duress of the war on Gaza, but the point is that by meeting the conditions set by the international community, Hamas wants to be seen as a legitimate political movement and not a militant or terrorist organization.The day after the end of the war is therefore complicated on many fronts. On the one hand, Hamas still holds Israeli civilians, soldiers, and senior officers, and at the same time, the Israeli army is suffering daily losses of its soldiers and equipment. International pressure and bad publicity are also on the rise, and the warm fuzzy days between President Biden and Netanyahu are quickly turning into a cold peace between the two allies.The next weeks and months will be sensitive, to say the least. Each side wants to end this war as a victor or at least not as the defeated. Yet the civilian toll of Palestinians and the anguish of those held by Hamas and Israel are all subject to the tough negotiations that aim at finding a common ground that could bring the region out of this unprecedented civilian and military carnage. While the pressure is mounting on both Netanyahu and Hamas, the only source of a breakthrough will come when leaders prioritize the common good for their people over personal or political interests. The internal fighting in Israel is the most obvious sign of the need to end the war, as are the mounting casualties among soldiers and officers, as well as the voices of the hostages’ families that are getting louder and louder. Israel under Netanyahu will try to drag things out as much as possible in order to be able to come out of this with any face-saving formula. Unable to reach any senior Hamas leaders, the Israelis have chosen the more political leaders abroad. This will do little to change the future status of Netanyahu or the overall outcome of this brutal war that has so reduced Israel’s standing.</p>

    <h1>They Lost Their Land to the Park Service. Now They’re Losing It to Climate Change.</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Tue, 09 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The high temperatures in Death Valley National Park attract tourists from all over the world. Big groups come in shiny luxury buses. Visiting  and , the park’s most frequented attractions, you’re likely to run into at least one film crew or fashion shoot from nearby L.A. And the luxury hotel the Inn at Death Valley boasts a forest of whispering palm trees, a lush golf course, a swimming pool, and gourmet seafood entrees in the middle of .Barbara Durham lives down the road from the Inn, in the Timbisha Shoshone Village—a small piece of reservation land created in 2000 by the Timbisha Shoshone Homeland Act. The law made Death Valley the first and only U.S. national park to legally allow its Indigenous inhabitants to remain where they have long lived, by returning land that was taken when the park was established.Today, the village of 25 households is still fighting for survival, but no longer against the park service. Now their enemy is extreme heat. And the legal right to live inside the park, once the most important thing to the Timbisha, is no longer enough to protect their way of life.Durham was born and raised here, becoming tribal historic preservation officer, or THPO, for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe a decade ago. Around the same time, the new visitor center, devoted in large part to rebranding the park as Timbisha Shoshone Homeland, was unveiled to visitors. Inside the dark, comfortably air-conditioned space, a movie featuring Durham and tribal elder Pauline Estevez explained the most important aspect of the Homeland Act: Not only can the Timbisha live in the village forever, but they can continue their seasonal movements around the park, to cope with dramatic changes in climate. Most importantly, they can spend summer—when the village is too hot—in the Panamint Mountains, during the annual piñon harvest. Moving between the valley and the mountains has made it possible for people to live in this extreme and variable climate for thousands of years. The right to live permanently in the village was just as important to survival as the annual migration into the mountains. What the film does not tell visitors is that there has been no piñon harvest for the past three years.Theodore Catton, author of the Homeland Act’s officially commissioned , referred to the battle over the village as “the Tribe’s Sarajevo.” Durham now compares it to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “That’s what was done to us,” she said, when the park service established Death Valley National Monument in the mid-1930s. The summer migration was used to drive the Timbisha away. For years, when the people moved into the mountains for the summer, park rangers were sent to the village with high-powered hoses to wash away their adobe huts. Estevez, born in 1924 and now almost a century old, remembers the systematic destruction of the homes.In order to fight the park service and receive the government aid they needed to continue living where they had always lived, the Timbisha needed tribal recognition. But without a land base, they could not be recognized. In 1983 the Timbisha became recognized as “non-ward Indians,” a tribe without a land base. Tribal government moved to Bishop, California, a three-hour drive away, leaving behind two deserted administrative buildings and a defunct radio station in the village. These days, Durham told me, few council members have even been to the reservation.For Estevez, the battle was always about winning back the land base, not about tribal recognition. “We’re not a ‘tribe,’” she explained to me. “We’re just the people who have always been here.” Their efforts included traveling to Europe to raise awareness of the situation, organizing with Greenpeace, and a formal appeal to the United Nations for protection from genocide. The Timbisha’s historic preservation meetings still consist of five elders, including Estevez.In April 2023, Mandi Campbell took over the THPO role from Durham, who had suffered four strokes and is now in her early seventies. Campbell, also born and raised here, explained to me that, while the older generation fought the park service to win back their homeland, her generation (she is in her late forties) is working together with the service to preserve it. This is also part of the Homeland Act, which stipulates co-management of the land between the Timbisha and the park service. But the village population is dwindling, and the median age keeps rising. At present, there is only one household with children.Despite how small, remote, and economically challenged the village is, Durham sees the Homeland Act as a key player in the country’s environmental and cultural healing. Death Valley is the only case in which the U.S. government has returned park land to its Indigenous inhabitants. Much of the opposition to the Homeland Act was on the grounds that it could set a precedent according to which other tribes would demand the return of federally managed land. The future of the Homeland Act, therefore, matters not only to the residents of the village, or to the Death Valley region, but to the future of the entire National Park Service, whose director,  III, is the first Native American in that role.And something even bigger is at stake. Death Valley is the largest federally designated wilderness in the lower 48 states. This makes it central to the new national , which focuses on wilderness as a primary tool in climate change mitigation. In the era of Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous secretary of the interior, environmentalists are looking to native knowledges and Indigenous land use across the globe more than ever to fortify wilderness conservation .But the Timbisha need more than just the right to their ancestral land. Living in the hottest place on earth, they need active, ongoing help with stewardship. Durham was happiest during the Covid closure, with all the park staff and tourists gone—“I miss it,” she said. “It was like it must have been long ago, was when it was just us.” But at the same time, she hopes for more involvement from the park service in protecting the Timbisha way of life. For the past three summers, the temperature in Furnace Creek has reached 130 degrees. The pine nuts have been drying up earlier in the year than they used to, pushing the harvest into August rather than September. But August is too hot, and the migration has become too dangerous to continue without housing to protect from the heat. As a result, there has been no piñon harvest for three years. According to Durham, the Timbisha want to use the existing park service housing in the Panamint—uninhabitable after decades of standing empty—to live in during the hottest months, and they are waiting for the park service to fix up those homes. (Multiple requests for comment to the park service went unanswered.) Durham also worries that, as the number of residents dwindles, the village will become less of a priority to Tribal Council. And along with the village, the Homeland Act will simply be forgotten, like some archaic piece of legislation. Campbell confirms that fewer and fewer Timbisha from the surrounding regions visit the village. The younger generations have stopped coming, she says, and as a result, “they don’t know the story.” She then adds, with emphasis, “I don’t know the story. I’m trying to learn.” Campbell is focused on the piñon nuts disappearing. Rising temperatures have changed all the vegetation beyond recognition. Piñons are becoming scarce for hundreds of square miles, not just in the Panamint, due to attacks by beetles following the recent excessive rains (the park saw its  this past August). At the same time, in this land of extremes, dryness is killing the honey mesquite, which the Timbisha use for food, juice, and firewood. The Furnace Creek area has been so dry that the ground turns to dust and rises into the air—a condition the Timbisha call “whiteout.”The Timbisha Shoshone’s struggle to preserve their culture now mirrors the struggle of their surrounding ecosystem. And that’s no coincidence—these were never separate things to begin with. The Timbisha’s autonomy is not a legal idea separate from where and how they live, or from their seasonal movements and their ability to take care of their environment. It’s not an abstraction separate from everyday life. It is their everyday life. I asked Campbell why she stays. “I want to try and protect what I can and build something for generations to come, so younger people will want to come back. Right now it’s just falling apart.” After a long pause, she added softly, “It’s home.”Death Valley is proof that  is just the beginning. The Timbisha Shoshone Homeland Act guaranteed the right to live in the park, but this alone is no longer enough. It was never enough. As temperatures continue to rise, the residents of the Timbisha Village will need more and more help actually living that life—taking care of the nature on which, in the end, all life depends.</p>

    <h1>Watch: GOP Official Panics When Asked for Reason to Remove Biden From Ballot</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 21:38:05 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft completely melted down on Monday when he tried to explain why it would be justified to kick Joe Biden off his state’s primary ballot.The U.S. Supreme Court  last week that it would decide whether Donald Trump should appear on . The former president has already been kicked off the ballot in Maine and Colorado. Ashcroft responded by  to remove Biden from the Missouri ballot if the Supreme Court doesn’t overturn the other states’ decisions.When CNN anchor Boris Sanchez asked Ashcroft what justification he would have for such a move, Ashcroft faltered.“There have been allegations that he’s engaged in insurrection,” Ashcroft said of Biden.When Sanchez pressed him to give more details, Ashcroft said he had “seen allegations from the lieutenant governor of Texas,” but then suddenly seemed incapable of stringing a sentence together.BORIS SANCHEZ: What would be your justification for removing Joe Biden from the ballot in Missouri?JAY ASHCROFT: There have been allegations that he's engaged in insurrectionSANCHEZ: How so?ASHCROFT: Um, I've seen allegations from the lieutenant governor of Texas — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) Earlier in the interview, Sanchez  why Ashcroft felt he had the authority to remove Biden from the ballot. The Missouri state Constitution says that the secretary of state cannot unilaterally disqualify a candidate and would need to challenge a candidate’s eligibility in court. Ashcroft accused Sanchez of lying.Ashcroft’s main argument seems to be that Trump shouldn’t be disqualified from a state ballot because he has not yet been convicted of insurrection, only accused of it. Ashcroft also said that states should not be able to disqualify candidates from the ballot, failing to see the irony of his threat to do just that to Biden.A major difference, though, is that Trump has been indicted twice, once at the  and again at the , for trying to overturn the 2020 election. And all of the  that has been reported  seems pretty damning.Trump was disqualified last month from the primary ballots in Colorado and Maine, after the  and  determined that he had engaged in insurrection and was therefore constitutionally ineligible to run for president.Shortly after the Colorado ruling, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick (whom Ashcroft referred to in Monday’s disastrous interview)  to kick Biden off the Lone Star State’s ballot in retribution.</p>

    <h1>Florida Republican Party Implodes as Chairman Removed for Rape Allegation</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 19:20:37 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Florida Republican Party overwhelmingly  on Monday to remove its chairman, Christian Ziegler, as police investigate him for a rape allegation.More than  attended the meeting, and almost all  to oust Ziegler, according to multiple reporters on scene. The party had already suspended Ziegler last month when the rape accusation first came to light and demanded he resign, but he had refused.Police in Sarasota, Florida, began investigating Ziegler late last year after a woman said he raped her at her apartment in October. Ziegler and his wife, Bridget Ziegler, a co-founder of the far-right group , have admitted they had previously had a consensual sexual relationship with the accuser.The woman says she and the Zieglers had planned to have a threesome on October 2, according to . Bridget Ziegler was unable to attend. Christian Ziegler allegedly arrived at the woman’s apartment alone and assaulted her.Neither of the Zieglers has been charged with a crime, but Christian Ziegler is currently under investigation. He is also being investigated for “video voyeurism.” According to police documents, Ziegler allegedly  the sexual encounter and then sent it to the woman on Instagram using “vanish mode.” Messages sent in “vanish mode” disappear after a certain period of time.The Florida Republican Party  one of its main reasons for asking him to leave was the concern the investigation would hinder his ability to successfully lead the party during a competitive election cycle. Ziegler has denied the allegations.Bridget Ziegler was asked to leave the Sarasota School Board, but she has refused. The Zieglers have repeatedly pushed , particularly in schools. Their consensual relationship with another woman has led many—including other conservative parental rights activists—to  Bridget Ziegler of hypocrisy.</p>

    <h1>You Could Soon Be Fined for Defamation for Calling Someone Racist in Florida</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 18:00:35 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A Florida Republican lawmaker has  a bill that would make it defamation to accuse someone of racism, sexism, homophobia, or transphobia, a measure that would deal a devastating blow to freedom of speech in the Sunshine State.The bill, which was  Friday, would make it much easier for someone to sue another person for defamation. The measure  that “an allegation that the plaintiff has discriminated against another person or group because of their race, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity constitutes defamation per se.”Proving “actual malice” is one of the main requirements of a successful defamation case. And this bill would make that easier, setting up conditions for a fact-finder to automatically infer that actual malice took place after an accusation of discrimination.In cases of alleged homophobia or transphobia, defendants charged with defamation are not allowed to use the plaintiff’s religious or scientific beliefs as part of their defense. If they are found liable for defamation, the defendant could be fined at least $35,000.The bill applies to statements made in print, on television, or on social media. It also states that someone who is caught in a viral video engaging in allegedly discriminatory behaviors does not qualify as a “public figure,” giving those people even more grounds to sue.Finally, the bill removes certain journalistic privileges, particularly the right to keep sources anonymous. Statements from anonymous sources would be considered “presumptively false,” making journalists reporting on discrimination vulnerable to lawsuits.“More attempts to chill free speech in the ‘free’ State of Florida,” Democratic state Representative Anna Eskamani  about the measure.The bill was introduced by state Senator Jason Brodeur, who, despite claiming he wants to protect free speech, has taken aim at the right to free speech multiple times. In 2023, he introduced  that would require paid bloggers who write about elected officials to register with the state. Such a registry of political writers and independent journalists would have allowed for increased surveillance.Brodeur’s new bill is almost an exact copy of another measure introduced early last year. That  passed the Civil Justice Subcommittee but ultimately failed in the Judiciary Committee.Florida increased its  over the course of 2023. With Republicans holding both chambers of the state legislature and the governor’s office, the new version might stand a chance.If the new bill does become law, it is unlikely to survive a legal challenge due to its clear violations of free speech and anti-discrimination laws. But as with so many , the point is not to create good legislation. The point is to .</p>

    <h1>Wild New Trump Ad Borrows Nazi Language to Attack Haley</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 16:30:02 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A new pro-Trump campaign ad is doubling down on the former president’s —and attacking Nikki Haley over her stance on immigration.Trump-allied super PAC MAGA Inc posted the video on X (formerly Twitter) Monday morning, marking the second time the group has specifically  Haley. The ad shows photos and video footage supposedly of the southern U.S. border, spliced with clips from a speech Haley gave in 2015.“Drug traffickers. Rapists. Poisoning our country,” the narrator . “But Nikki Haley refused to call illegals ‘criminals.’”“Illegals are criminals, Nikki. That’s what illegal means,” the ad says, branding Haley as “too weak” and “too liberal” on immigration.During a 2015 event in Colorado, Haley  it was “incredibly frustrating” to see the massive influx of undocumented immigrants, but warned it was “disrespectful” to dismiss them as criminals.“We don’t need to talk about them as criminals, they’re not,” said Haley, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants. “They’re families that want a better life and they’re desperate to get here.”Monday’s ad is the second time MAGA Inc has taken specific aim at Haley. At the end of 2023, the super PAC spent nearly $3.5 million on anti-Haley ads, mailers, and text messages. Haley has seen a steady rise in the polls. RealClearPolitics’s  of the last three weeks of polling currently has Haley in second place, ahead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was once touted as Trump’s natural successor. Trump still enjoys a hefty lead, though.But more importantly, the ad is a clear sign that  and his supporters are totally fine . Trump has previously claimed immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” When critics rightfully pointed out that this was language straight out of Hitler’s Mein Kampf, Trump claimed he’d never read the Nazi manifesto, only to then  decry immigrants for “destroying the blood of our country.” And the MAGA Inc ad similarly claims that immigrants are “poisoning our country.”It seems that Trump is gearing up to keep that extremist train of thought going should he return to the White House,  in December that he would abuse his powers if reelected. He also might bring his former adviser  back as attorney general.Miller, an open white nationalist,  in December that the United States is being overrun by immigrants and can only be saved by “massive” deportations.</p>

    <h1>That One Jan. 6 Tweet Trump Cites as His Defense? He Didn’t Even Write It!</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 15:34:03 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong>  has repeatedly insisted he urged January 6 rioters to protest peacefully. But according to a new report, he didn’t even write one of the main tweets he cites in this defense.Some of Trump’s closest allies revealed to special counsel Jack Smith, who has indicted Trump for trying to overthrow the 2020 election, that the former president refused to help stop the insurrection, ABC  on Sunday, citing anonymous sources close to Smith’s investigation.Trump’s longtime adviser and former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino said that even as the violence increased, Trump was “just not interested” in stopping it. Instead, Trump was content to sit and watch the riot unfold on television.Sources told ABC that former Trump aide Nick Luna had at one point warned his boss that then–Vice President Mike Pence had to be taken to a secure location. Trump replied, “So what?”Trump then tweeted that Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.” His advisers were shocked he would add such incendiary commentary to the growing riot.As the situation grew worse, Scavino said he printed out potential tweets Trump could post to urge the rioters not to get violent. At 2:38 p.m., after many protesters had already breached the Capitol, Trump finally let Scavino post a message on Trump’s Twitter (now called X) account telling the mob to “stay peaceful.”Minutes later, Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot dead when she tried to break through a barricaded entrance. The insurrection did not stop until Trump—after nearly two hours of begging from his aides, advisers, family members, and allies in Congress—posted a video telling his supporters, “Go home. We love you. You’re very special.”Since he was  in August for his role in the January 6 attack, Trump and his lawyers have continually  that he told the crowd to be peaceful. And Trump did, exactly twice. Once during his  at the Ellipse, when he said, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” And a second time in his weak tweet.But during his speech, Trump couched that one reference to peaceful protest in a stream of otherwise incendiary rhetoric. He  that he had won the election and that Pence and Congress had the right not to certify Joe Biden’s win. And his speech ultimately whipped the crowd up into an angry mob that stormed the Capitol.As for his tweet, it now turns out that Trump wasn’t all that pressed to urge for peace anyway. </p>

    <h1>Flaubert Versus the World</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The last time I tried to “teach”  was in an advanced undergraduate course at a London university, and I had expected better results. The students either hated it or found it “boring,” and even when they did “sort of like” it, they hated the central character and said things like: “How can I like someone who cheats on their husband?” Or “That woman had everything and she was never happy.” They found Emma completely unsympathetic—a problem I never had teaching other novels about adulterous women, such as Kate Chopin’s  or Tolstoy’s  (which was, of course, inspired by Flaubert’s earlier and much better novel).For while Bovary is one of the undisputed classics of Western literature, it’s hard to think of a famous novel that is disliked with such intensity by the common reader. To a large extent, it may be because Emma is almost completely unapologetic about her betrayals; all she ever really cares about is herself and indulging in her endless reveries about living the beautiful life in Paris that she read about in mediocre novels. But of course it is Emma’s selfishness, and her impossible yearning for a world better than awful middle-class Rouen, that makes her so alive and almost heroic. In many ways, she lives more fully on the page than many of us do in life.Flaubert despised the middle-class desire to confirm moral lessons and comfortable truths in its entertainments; he is also very broadly disliked by the sorts of readers who go looking for such things. For him, both the reading and writing of great fiction meant staging a retreat from the demands of society and even from social life itself. What this large, chronologically arranged selection of his letters to friends and family shows is just how avowedly and self-consciously he spent his career becoming as “désengagé” as possible. (The more politically attuned Sartre, whose unappreciative biography of Flaubert was titled , once referred to him as a “talented coupon clipper.”) It is safe to say Flaubert didn’t like the world he wrote about as much as he liked creating fictional alternatives to it. And he didn’t simply struggle to find the right word for each of his lovely, intricately beautiful sentences; he continuously sought to invent an aesthetically pleasing world that was composed almost entirely of such perfect words, sentences, and paragraphs.Turning away from the world was a big part of Flaubert’s literary method. Each of his books—and to some degree, each of his effusive, emotionally intense letters to friends and lovers—is an opportunity to shut all the distracting doors and windows and bathe in the splendor of great literary prose. Flaubert was born in 1821 in Rouen, a provincial town he despised and yet rarely left. His father was a celebrated local physician, and as a consequence Flaubert grew up witnessing the most tragic extremes of human existence. As Francis Steegmuller described in  (1939), Flaubert and his sister would climb the trellises outside their house and watch “their father and his assistants and students peeling and dissecting cadavers. Their bodies, covered with flies, lay on their marble slabs; on the trunks of what had once been human beings the students carelessly rested their burning cigars.” At other times, while playing in the garden, they saw wild dogs running about clutching “bits of human debris” in their teeth. During the 1832 cholera epidemic, the sick and dying often gathered in the streets.From an early age, Flaubert preferred the beautiful vistas he discovered in books, and yet he could never avoid the most awful truths of human existence: disease, disintegration, illness, and death. He felt both a cynical distrust of bourgeois fantasies—that individuals could, through education and hard work, rise above the animal limitations of their bodies—and a deep abiding sympathy for those human beings foolish enough to believe them. From an early age, Flaubert preferred the beautiful vistas he discovered in books, and yet he could never avoid the most awful truths of human existence: disease, disintegration, illness, and death.His parents wanted Flaubert to pursue everything about bourgeois professional life that he despised; and it is perhaps only because of several illnesses and tragedies that Flaubert escaped the fate they mapped out for him. In the midst of his miserable adventures as a law student in Paris (“What a marvelous idea it was of somebody’s to invent the Law School for the express purpose of boring the shit out of us!”), he began suffering a series of epileptic seizures that sent him home for weeks at a time; he was afflicted with huge painful boils on his neck and body, bad teeth, gout, and very probably syphilis; then, over a miserable couple of years, those closest to him began dying—first his father, then his beloved sister, and finally the dearest friend of his youth, Alfred Le Poittevin. Without these misfortunes and ailments, he might never have cultivated his solitary nature. As he wrote Le Poittevin in May 1845, “The only way not to be unhappy is to shut yourself up in Art and count all the rest as nothing.”I have said an irrevocable farewell to the practical life. My nervous illness was the transition between two states. From now until a day that is far distant I ask for no more than five or six quiet hours in my room, a good fire in winter, and a pair of candles to light me at night.By shutting himself up with “Art” (a word he always capitalized), he could just as firmly shut his door on the world. “I hate life,” he wrote to another youthful friend, Maxime Du Camp. “There: I have said it; I’ll not take it back. Yes, life; and everything that reminds me that life must be borne. It bores me to eat, to dress, to stand on my feet, etc. I have dragged this hatred everywhere, wherever I have been: at school, in Rouen, in Paris, on the Nile.” The world’s temptations stopped being so tempting as Flaubert grew older. Partly it was his faulty body falling apart. But in reading his letters, it is clear that much of the passion was simply knocked clean out of him. This was especially evident in his correspondence with Louise Colet. Eleven years Flaubert’s senior, she was already a subject of gossip in Paris before they met in the Paris studio of a mutual friend. (She once replied to a detractor by trying to stab him with a kitchen knife.) For Flaubert, however, she was the only brief lapse into romantic pleasure that he ever allowed himself, and his first letters are filled with the gushings of a young man. After their first night together, in the summer of 1846, he wrote her at midnight:Twelve hours ago we were still together, and at this very moment yesterday I was holding you in my arms! Do you remember? How long ago it seems! Now the night is soft and warm; I can hear the great tulip tree under my window rustling in the wind, and when I lift my head I see the moon reflected in the river.… What memories! And what desire! Ah! Our two marvelous carriage rides; how beautiful they were, particularly the second, with the lightning flashes above us. I keep remembering the color of the trees lit by the streetlights, and the swaying motion of the springs. We were alone, happy: I kept staring at you, and even in the darkness your whole face seemed illumined by your eyes. I feel I am writing badly—you will read this without emotion—I am saying nothing of what I want to say. My sentences run together like sighs, to understand them you will have to supply what should go between. You will do that, won’t you? In these early letters, Flaubert indulges himself in all the romantic hyperbole that will so preoccupy (and eventually doom) his greatest creation, Emma Bovary; and while Flaubert is often remembered as being cynical about romantic love, it’s clear from his correspondence that he wasn’t always that way. He could create Emma Bovary because he knew her from the inside out and, as he reportedly (and famously) remarked: “Madame Bovary, c’est moi, d’aprés moi!” (“Madame Bovary is myself—drawn from life.”)But within weeks, Flaubert is already telling Louise how incompatible his feelings for her are with his desire to shut himself away. In a letter dated August 9, 1846, he instructs her to “be more sparing with your cries; they are torturing me.” He writes that he wants “to live in a place where no one loves me or knows me, where the sound of my name causes only indifference, where my death or my absence costs no one a tear” and complains, “I have been too much loved, you see; you love me too much.”Until finally their passion lies bloodless in a series of letters that are cold, angry, accusatory, and threatening; and the more emotional Louise gets, the more Flaubert retreats into an indifference to both women and, almost as importantly, Paris. Before the end of their first month together, he writes:Anger! Good God! Vituperation, invective! Lurid language! What does it mean? That you like disputes, recriminations, all the bitter daily wrangling that ends by making life a real hell? I don’t understand. You complain of my hard words, but it seems to me that I never sent you any to equal these. Perhaps you’ll say I have written you even more harshly: everyone has his illusions. But in your letter of this morning I see something more, a deliberate intent to be nasty, or to seem so. Who knows?Flaubert lived a lifetime of passion, rage, and hurt feelings in his intense relationship with a very intense woman. But while the relationship lingered on for several years, during which time Flaubert often reported to her his daily progress on Bovary, he eventually shut the door on Louise as firmly as he did on the rest of the world. In a letter dated March 6, 1855, he writes:Madame: I was told that you took the trouble to come here to see me three times last evening.I was not in. And, fearing lest persistence expose you to humiliation, I am bound by the rules of politeness to warn you that I shall never be in.Yours,G.F. While it’s hard not recognize Emma Bovary in the adolescent romantic who yearned for better-than-this-world adventures, it’s just as easy to see the more methodical, womanizing rogue, Rodolphe, who could produce the required tears to place telltale stains on his last letter to Emma, and subsequently smokes his pipe and goes to bed. “Am I really to have a goal other than Art itself?” he asked his close friend Maxime Du Camp in 1851—and by this point, it was a rhetorical question. “It alone has been sufficient for me until now; and if I need something more, that is proof that I am deteriorating. And if I enjoy the additional something, that is proof that I have deteriorated already.” “Am I really to have a goal other than Art itself?” Flaubert asked his close friend in 1851—and by this point, it was a rhetorical question.With the death of his mighty initial passion for Louise, Flaubert grew deliberately indifferent to the world beyond provincial Croisset, where he recuperated from various ailments and, when he wasn’t writing Madame Bovary, read his work in progress out loud to visitors. It was as if Flaubert were building his own reality, word by word, just as his characters are driven to devise an existence more beautiful than their mundane routines of jobs, political appointments, financially advantageous liaisons, and disappointing marriages. Certainly Flaubert did all he could to escape these predicaments himself. He never married. He avoided becoming a literary institution in his old age. And rather than sire children, he inspired the future of French letters through his greatest admirers: Maupassant, Zola, and Proust.Which is probably why the characters who most intrigued Flaubert were those who lived their lives largely apart from social responsibilities, if only inside their own minds: Emma Bovary, with her romance novels, her liaisons, and her passion for fine clothes and fabrics; St. Antony with his tantalizing, multifarious demons; or even the servant girl, Félicité, in his most moving and memorable story, “A Simple Heart,” who finds her pleasures in attending church services, collecting knickknacks, and conversing with her most dependable companion, a stuffed parrot. (At one point, Flaubert describes her private room in a moldering old house as containing “such a quantity of religious bric-à-brac and miscellaneous oddments that it looked like a cross between a chapel and a bazaar.”) There is something ridiculous, wildly aspirational, and pathetic about the characters for whom Flaubert feels the strongest emotional connection; and in the letters, he sees himself in similar terms. Late in life he advised his friend (and the nephew of his adored Le Poittevin) Guy de Maupassant: “Too many whores! Too much rowing! Too much exercise! Yes, sir: civilized man doesn’t need as much locomotion as the doctors pretend. You were born to write poetry: write it! All the rest is futile.” It’s impossible to think of any other writer who proved such a large influence on two seemingly antithetical schools of fiction—both the “realistic novel” and the “romance.” In his two major works—Sentimental and Bovary—he focuses on individuals driven by finance, sex, and politics even while they seek something more aesthetically fulfilling. On the other hand, Flaubert’s two lesser-known works—St. Antony and Salammbo—are extravagant, zaftig, phantasmagoric visions. But in both types of novel, Flaubert constructs his unique fictions from the ground up and according to literary techniques that he either perfected or invented.His characters almost uniformly fail to escape either their desires or the hard embrace of economic realities, and they are ultimately dragged down to earth by either a painful death (poor self-poisoned Emma) or the blunt ironies of comfortable bourgeois life (Frédéric in Sentimental Education). The only characters who aren’t thus dismantled are the comic protagonists, , who never fail since they never see beyond the idiocies of their middle-class educations or the “truisms” (examples of which Flaubert cataloged in his Dictionary of Received Ideas) they continually spout at one another like parrots in an echo chamber (such as that nightmares “come from the stomach” or that novels “corrupt the masses”). Which may be why Flaubert expresses such a mixed admiration for religious ceremonies—for while their stories about gods and salvation may be nonsense, they were the closest to “Art” that most people ever got. He describes his own withdrawal from social life as a sort of mystical yearning, and after the loss of his sister and father, he told Louise that he was “turning toward a kind of aesthetic mysticism.”When you are given no encouragement by others, when the outside world disgusts, weakens, corrupts, and stupefies you, so-called “decent” and “sensitive” people are forced to seek somewhere within themselves a more suitable place to live. If society continues on its present path, I think we shall once again see mystics, such as existed in all dark ages. Unable to expand, the soul will concentrate on itself. The time is not far off when there will be a resurgence of melancholy fantasies, the expectation of a Messiah, beliefs in the approaching end of the world. But lacking any theological foundation, what will be the basis of this fervor? (It will certainly be ignorant concerning itself.) Some will seek it in the flesh, others in the ancient religions, still others in Art.It was the closest to prophetic words that Flaubert ever spoke—imagining a future in which the bourgeoisie, or the working class, felt so betrayed by the silly things they dreamed of achieving that they could only be disappointed; at which point they might turn to darker, de Sadean dreams of power and cruelty. But at the end of the day, Flaubert expressed little interest in where the political and socioeconomic world would take humanity; he was more concerned with either creating his own immaculate fictions or escaping to the parlor with his small circle of friends.Soon after the death of his mother, Flaubert wrote to a similar soul, Ivan Turgenev:But alas! My ailment is incurable, I fear. Besides my personal reasons for grief (the death during the last three years of almost everyone I loved), I am appalled by the state of society. Yes, such is the case. Stupid, perhaps, but there it is. The stupidity of the public overwhelms me … The bourgeoisie is so bewildered that it has lost all instinct to defend itself; and what will succeed it will be worse. I’m filled with the sadness that afflicted the Roman patricians of the fourth century: I feel irredeemable barbarism rising from the bowels of the earth. I hope to be gone before it carries everything away. But meanwhile it’s not very gay. Never have things of the spirit counted for so little. Never has hatred for everything great been so manifest—disdain for Beauty, execration of literature.I have always tried to live in an ivory tower, but a tide of shit is beating at its walls, threatening to undermine it.It was a complaint Flaubert would continue raising through the final days of his life—that a world overly concerned with who ran things and who profited by them would have no time for the beauties he had spent his life creating. And it may be the final irony of his existence that readers who grow up today knowing his name rarely have the patience and attention to enjoy his work as much as it deserves.</p>

    <h1>The Nation’s Capital Is Falling Behind on Fighting Violent Crime. Here’s Why.</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In 2023, most large U.S. cities saw a precipitous drop in the rate of homicides. Despite the public perception of a rise in violent crime in major metropolitan areas, cities like Chicago and New York City saw  in murders from 2022. But a few cities bucked that trend, including the nation’s capital. With the fifth-highest murder rate among the country’s most populous cities, Washington, D.C. has drawn national attention for its recent spike in violent crime.The statistics are sobering: 2023 was the District’s deadliest year since 1997, with 274 recorded homicides. With 40 homicides per 100,000 residents—an  from the previous year—D.C.’s high murder rate contrasted with falling levels in most other major cities, an ominous reminder of the District’s unofficial status in the late twentieth century as “America’s murder capital.” The high number of homicides was inextricable from gun violence, as the majority of these homicides were caused by firearms.Violent crime in the District also increased dramatically in 2023, rising 39 percent compared to the previous year. Here, it’s worth noting that “crimes of violence” are  under the D.C. Code, including robbery, burglary, and homicide; pickpocketing, for example, constitutes the same offense of robbery as being robbed at gunpoint. Nonetheless, the numbers are jarring: In 2023, there were 959 reported carjackings. Juveniles and teenaged adults  for carjacking, according to Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for D.C.As the problem of crime in D.C. has garnered national attention—due in part, no doubt, because of its status as the nation’s capital and seat of government—politicians in D.C. have found themselves on the defensive. Several District officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have recently testified before Congress. In March 2023, the D.C. Council  that would have updated its criminal code, largely because of opposition from House Republicans and many congressional Democrats. The District is unique in that laws passed by the Council must be reviewed by Congress, further granting the issue of crime in D.C. national political salience.But understanding the spike in violent crime in D.C.—which itself often involves guns—is not a simple task. Criminal justice experts believe that considering violence in the District must involve an examination of the structural problems that have left its most vulnerable residents behind.Structural CausesIssues of racial inequality and gentrification are not unique to D.C., but they are particularly intense in the District. Once known as “Chocolate City” due to its majority-Black population, the District has seen a dramatic change in demographics in recent decades, with Black residents accounting for  of the city’s population in 2022. “If you look at D.C. in the year 2000, for example, there were no low-income white neighborhoods. So gentrification in D.C. is always a racialized process,” said Tanya Golash-Boza, the executive director of the University of California, Washington Center and the author of Before Gentrification: The Creation of DC’s Racial Wealth Gap.When higher-income, primarily white residents move into redeveloped neighborhoods, it is the Black residents who are displaced, said Golash-Boza. Compared to their white counterparts, Black residents of the District are  to live in poverty and be unemployed, disproportionately  that experience higher rates of homicide, and even  to health care. All of these factors contribute to a sense of “relative deprivation,” said Golash-Boza. “The idea is not just that you’re poor but also that you can see other people around you with more,” she said.The Navy Yard neighborhood in southeast D.C., for example, has experienced radical change in the past 20 years. In 2005, Navy Yard had a similar profile to Anacostia, the area of D.C. just across the Anacostia River. But in the intervening years, it has experienced rapid redevelopment, becoming a site for a Major League Baseball stadium, luxury apartments, and trendy restaurants and bars. Not only have the primarily Black residents who used to live in Navy Yard been displaced, the residents of Anacostia—which has been hardest hit by rising violent crime rates—can look across the river and see development that isn’t occurring in their own neighborhood.Physical, social, and cultural displacement is a major throughline for the experiences of Black residents of D.C. During the twentieth century, Black citizens of the District were subject to “redlining,” the historic practice of refusing loans to certain applicants based on race, entrenching them in low-income neighborhoods. But when that land became valuable, said Joseph Richardson, a professor at the University of Maryland who researches gun violence and trauma, “their homes are then razed and they’re displaced.”“That destabilization of communities is happening all around D.C., and I don’t think you could expect—in these totally destabilized communities—to not have a negative effect that comes out of that,” Richardson said. “That could be gun violence, that could be crime, that could be carjacking—but I don’t think in any space, in any city in the country, you could engage in that level of rapid displacement without it having an impact.”Physical, social, and cultural displacement is a major throughline for the experiences of Black residents of D.C.Poverty itself can be a kind of risk factor for involvement in crime. Patrice Sulton, the executive director of the DC Justice Lab, recalled meeting with clients in her previous career as a defense attorney. If a client went a significant period of time without being incarcerated or otherwise involved with the criminal justice system, it was typically because they had managed to obtain a job during the intervening time or had gained access to mentorship if they were a juvenile. She argued that indicators of poverty, such as food insecurity, were connected to their likelihood of exposure to crime.“It should be obvious that it’s dangerous to live in a city where you have over 100,000 people who don’t have enough food,” said Sulton. How Youth Are AffectedThere has been particular consternation about an apparent rise in youth involvement in violent crime. The headline statistic, of course, is that jarring revelation by the U.S. attorney’s office that juveniles and teenage adults  for carjacking in 2023.It’s worth taking these statistics with a grain of salt: Kristin Henning, a professor at Georgetown Law and director of the Juvenile Justice Clinic and Institute at Georgetown Law, noted that the Metropolitan Police Department had a relatively low closure rate for carjacking cases, meaning that it’s difficult to tell with certainty who is committing the most crimes. Most violent crimes, she continued, are driven by adults, with carjackings as an outlier.“Young people are far more likely to get caught,” said Henning. “To the extent that we use that kind of data to demonize children—and to be clear, in the District of Columbia, that means demonizing Black children—we have to be really, really careful.”Nonetheless, the involvement of youth in violent crime, whether as victims or perpetrators, is a disturbing trend. Nineteen children and teenagers were killed in 2023, 16 of them by gunfire. Violence intervention advocates on the ground have described a youth culture defined by social media feuds that spill out into the real world, as well as an underground rap scene that can . (D.C. implemented a  in December, despite  that such policies do not reduce crime.)Relatively easy access to firearms complicates the issue. Although the District itself has relatively strict gun laws, many D.C. residents—including young people—are easily able to obtain firearms from outside of the city. For many teenagers living in areas with high rates of violent crime, there is a persistent belief that they need to obtain guns to protect themselves.“So many of the young people who come into the juvenile legal system aren’t the shooters, they aren’t the killers, they aren’t the ones who are violent, even if they have a gun,” said Henning. “Many of them now have guns for their own safety [but] are shaking like a leaf or terrified to even have it on their person.”Displacement and poverty may exacerbate those factors that could turn youth to violence. Jawanna Hardy, the founder of Guns Down Friday, a D.C.-based violence intervention group, recalled working with a young man who preferred being incarcerated to his life at home.“So many of the young people who come into the juvenile legal system aren’t the shooters, they aren’t the killers, they aren’t the ones who are violent, even if they have a gun.”“He came home, and two weeks later he was locked back up again. Not because he’s a bad kid. When he came home, he went right back to the streets, because there were no programs for him,” Hardy said.Advocates believe that the struggles faced by young people in D.C. are precipitated in part by a relative lack of access to recreation and mentorship programs and to mental health support, particularly in schools. The coronavirus pandemic only exacerbated these trends.The pandemic was devastating for children across the country, with school closures affecting their academic performance and social development. But it was particularly dire in D.C., where so many children live in poverty. Whereas a child in a middle-class household in the suburbs might have their own bedroom to use as a remote classroom and could play outside during the pandemic, a poor child in Washington, D.C., could be living in a very small apartment with no privacy.“So the impact of poverty literally drives children outside in ways in which they are subjected to the impulsive whim of delinquent acts,” Henning said.Insufficient InvestmentMany criminal justice advocates in D.C. believe there is a lack of proper investment in preexisting violence prevention programs, as well as a seeming disinterest in implementing new policies to address the root causes of gun violence and crime. The office of the D.C. attorney general and the mayor’s office each have so-called “violence interrupter” initiatives, which deploy community-based individuals rather law enforcement to deescalate violence. While ambitious in scope, these programs are far from perfect: Having two separate offices administering violence interruption programs can make the response disjointed. Moreover, some violence interrupters are not adequately trained, or may not be responsive in times of need. “In school, you know, you might have 50 teachers, and out of those 50 teachers, 10 of those teachers are excellent teachers that the kids want to work with,” said Hardy. “It’s the same with violence interruption. They have a handful of people that are really doing an awesome job, and then you have people who are just collecting a check, and no one’s holding anyone accountable.”The District has also been rocked by several changes in leadership in recent years, which in turn affects the approach to addressing crime. Since 2016, there have been four chiefs of the Metropolitan Police Department, including one interim chief. The current chief, Pamela Smith, was formally  by the Council in November. The city’s violence prevention efforts were also rocked by tragedy, when Linda Harllee Harper, the beloved director of the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement,  this past summer.“I think personnel really matter,” said D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson in an interview, adding that quality of leadership “is a subtle but significant factor.” He also expressed some frustration with Bowser, saying that she “has not been helpful in frequent press conferences which just create more public concern and suggest that the answer here is passing tougher laws.”Meanwhile, the relationships between federal and local agencies can be rocky. In 2022, federal prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C.  67 percent of arrests that would have been tried in D.C. Superior Court. At the time, Graves, the U.S. attorney, cited multiple reasons, including the lack of accreditation for D.C.’s crime lab. The lab  at the end of last year, which in theory should make it easier to prosecute crimes.Another difficulty is in determining appropriate targeting for violence prevention. A  by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, or NICJR, found that around 500 identifiable people comprise roughly 60 to 70 percent of all gun violence in D.C. Also in 2022, the NICJR  including recommendations for reducing gun violence in the District. In December, Mendelson  incorporating recommendations from this report, including a “focused deterrence” strategy that would allow law enforcement to target repeat violent offenders. Such a program has had success in other major cities, such as Boston. (Smith, the police chief, has emphasized —allocating officers to areas experiencing the most crime.)As of January 5, there have been two homicides in the District—the same number as this point last year.In an interview, Mendelson said that this proposal—which would require the mayor to move forward with policies already largely within their power to administer—would supplement preexisting programs. Mendelson gave the example of a John Doe, a known repeat violent offender. “The violence interrupter may reach out to work with him, to counsel him, to redirect him,” Mendelson said. “Law enforcement would be on the lookout for him committing another offense, and getting him locked up and prosecuted with swift and certain justice.”The D.C. Council—like any other legislative body—is rife with clashing political agendas. Multiple council members, as well as Bowser, have offered individual legislation to address crime, complicating the passage of any one bill. Bowser’s proposals include the , which would create penalties for “organized retail theft” and allow the Metropolitan Police Department Chief to declare “drug-free zones” intended to prevent open-air drug deals. She has also called on the Council to pass a permanent version of her , emergency crime response legislation that passed last year.“In 2024, we are focused on additional policies, policing strategies, and strategic partnerships needed to reduce crime and increase safety in all eight Wards,” said Lindsey Appiah, deputy mayor for public safety and justice, in a statement. It’s unclear whether 2024 will be an improvement on 2023. As of January 5, there have been two homicides in the District—the same number as at this point last year. Richardson, the University of Maryland, questioned whether there is the “political will” to address the structural factors that underlie the numbers.“You could take a 15, 20 minute drive to another section of the city and gain 20 years of your life. And that’s not just the result of gun violence, that’s the result of structural racism and oppression,” Richardson said. “It’s not just about who died, it’s about who was left for dead.”</p>

    <h1>Elon Musk’s Odious One-Man War Against Labor Law Just May Succeed</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> When the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, dings a corporation for a labor violation, the typical chief executive’s response is to shrug and pay the man the $5. Corporations with a public image to protect may litigate matters for a while, but litigation is expensive—whereas NLRB penalties are scandalously cheap, consisting typically only of reinstatement and back pay to whoever got fired, the posting of public notices, or perhaps a modest change to workplace procedures. The NLRB is not permitted to issue fines or to reward the victim with punitive damages. The  would change that, leveling penalties of up to $100,000 per violation and holding corporate officers individually liable. Unfortunately, the PRO Act isn’t going to become law in this Congress.Elon Musk is not a typical chief executive, or even a typical corporate scofflaw. Pick a corporate big shot. Mark Zuckerberg? A search of the NLRB’s website turns up three hits. Travis Kalanick, the famously obnoxious founder of Uber? Two hits. Jeff Bezos, whose union-busting at Amazon is ? Eighteen. Enter “Elon Musk,” though, and the NLRB search engine turns up no fewer than 86 hits. Musk relishes union-busting so much that he craves an audience for it. In 2018, when Musk wanted to threaten Tesla plant workers with the loss of their stock options if they unionized, he did it . The NLRB ruled Musk in violation of the Wagner Act; the (anti-regulatory) Fifth Circuit  the decision and ordered Musk to remove his tweet; Musk, who by now owned Twitter (now doing business as X), left it up anyway. The matter is currently being reviewed by the Fifth Circuit en banc.More recently, a regional NLRB director issued a  concerning a third Musk company, Space X, which fired eight employees illegally for circulating a letter protesting Musk’s “inappropriate, disparaging, sexually charged comments on Twitter.” That too is a straight-up violation of the Wagner Act; the case will be heard in March. In the meantime, Space X this week filed  arguing that the NLRB, which Congress created before Musk’s parents were born, ought not to exist. Not content to run Twitter into the ground, Musk now wants to repeal the New Deal. Naturally, that would be catastrophic, but this isn’t one of Musk’s nuttier crusades. He’s got a lot of allies sitting on the Supreme Court.Musk’s Space X lawsuit argues that the NLRB is “an unconstitutionally structured agency” because its administrative law judges, or ALJs, can’t be fired by the president; because the NLRB performs both prosecutorial and judicial functions, thereby violating separation of powers; and because the NLRB’s board members, though appointed by the president, can be fired only for cause. His lawsuit also suggests that Congress can’t delegate judicial functions to an independent agency, an ancient argument the Supreme Court set aside when it reconciled itself in the late 1930s to the New Deal’s “alphabet agencies.”Miraculously, the NLRB’s constitutional deficiencies went unnoticed by the courts for 89 years. They warrant attention now because the NLRB is inconveniencing Musk and his various companies.If these arguments sound familiar, that’s because they’re part of Donald Trump’s war on the administrative state, which Trump’s then–chief strategist, Steve Bannon, pledged to “” in 2017. In 2018 Trump issued an  giving the executive branch greater latitude in the hiring and firing of the federal government’s roughly 2000 ALJs (though not at the NLRB, where ALJs enjoy statutory protection). This was denounced by the ALJs’ professional organization, the Association of Administrative Law Judges, essentially as a return to the corrupt nineteenth-century . It will, the group  “politicize our courts, lead to cronyism and replace independent and impartial adjudicators with those who do the bidding of political appointees.” On Trump’s way out the door in late November 2020, his administration also moved  a federal employees union for immigration ALJs, initiating a proceeding that remains unresolved.The arguments in Musk’s lawsuit parrot those made in , a case before the Supreme Court this term. The plaintiffs, led by a hedge fund manager and sometime Fox News blowhard named George Jarkesy, got  by the SEC for securities fraud and fined $300,000; in addition, the SEC barred Jarkesy from the securities industry. Like the NLRB, the SEC is barred statutorily from ALJs serving at the pleasure of the president. ALJs can be fired only for cause. The Fifth Circuit, the most conservative appeals court in the United States,  that this arrangement is unconstitutional, and the SEC appealed to the Supreme Court. The Fifth Circuit also held that the SEC can’t perform both prosecutorial and judicial functions and that Congress lacks the power to delegate judicial adjudication to the SEC. The New Republic’s Matt Ford,  in November on the Supreme Court’s oral arguments in Jarkesy, said the justices seemed entirely uninterested in the for-cause argument and only “fleetingly” interested in the nondelegation question (though  have previously signaled a troubling eagerness to address it). But the justices seemed very interested in voiding Jarkesy’s SEC penalties on the grounds that the poor man didn’t get a jury trial. According to Fortune’s Greg Stohr and Bloomberg, Musk is  Jarkesy’s legal challenge. Their obvious shared goal is to cripple regulatory agencies’ ability to pursue their fellow rich white-collar lawbreakers. I’m not familiar with all the details of Jarkesy’s case, but (also according to Fortune) he “said he didn’t recall more than 800 times during questioning at the SEC about deceiving investors.” Innocent parties tend to have less faulty powers of recollection.Raise your hand if you think white-collar lawbreakers are treated too harshly in the U.S. White-collar prosecutions  for the past decade,  TRAC, a nonprofit data tracker maintained by Syracuse University, and at the start of 2023 (the last year for which data are available), they’d fallen to a 41-year low. Seventy percent of all criminal referrals to the federal government result in prosecutions, but for white-collar prosecutions that proportion falls to 38 percent. The only types of criminal referrals less likely to result in prosecutions are those involving official corruption (34 percent), internal security or terrorism (25 percent), and civil rights (23 percent). Regulatory agencies like the NLRB and the SEC pursue civil violations, not criminal ones, which by definition means they’re much more limited than prosecutors in the punishments they can impose. But there’s a growing likelihood that the Supreme Court will weaken even this pursuit of white-collar lawbreaking when it rules in Jarkesy and then, later, when it rules in another set of cases that deal with the “,” which limits how much judges like the reactionaries on the Fifth Circuit can cancel regulatory actions.Bannon wasn’t lying when he said the Trump administration would move to deconstruct the administrative state; all it took was Trump’s appointment of three justices to the Supreme Court. Musk is famous for entertaining a lot of seriously crazy notions, but his idea that he can get the NLRB off his back by shutting it down, sad to say, isn’t crazy at all.</p>

    <h1>We Are Sleepwalking Into a Dangerous Primary Season</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anyone under the age of 40 reading this may find it hard to believe, but there was a time when the Republican Party had a brain. There were a number of interesting Republicans—moderates, even liberals (if you go back far enough)—and thoughtful conservatives who, though conservative and ergo anti-government, bothered to learn enough about policy details so that they could shrink the government knowledgeably rather than recklessly. There was something else about those Republicans, even the conservative ones. They understood the value of compromise. They accepted the reality that there was such a thing as the Democratic Party, and that it represented and spoke for millions of Americans. They knew that America wasn’t theirs to remake solely in their image. So they cut deals, which is what we hire politicians to do.Today, a week out from the Iowa caucuses, which are a sham and a farce and a pantomime, we look at the Republican Party, and what we see is a diseased organism that has become three things: a crime syndicate, a treasonous clique devoted to ending the United States of America as we’ve known it, and an Orwellian reality-inverter worthy of 1930s Pravda.We’ll get to all that, but first, let’s talk about these upcoming caucuses and this primary process. There was a time when the presidential primaries, and the Iowa caucuses in particular, were the process by which the party decided what it stood for. In the 1970s and ’80s, there really was a battle for the soul of the GOP. On one side were the traditional establishment moneyed Republicans—the kind Alice Roosevelt-Longworth had in mind when she jibed in 1940 that Wendell Willkie’s campaign was launched “from the grassroots of a thousand country clubs.” On the other side was the New Right, led by evangelical figures like Jerry Falwell.We know who won that battle. But even long after the New Right’s takeover, there were still enough shades of difference among the Republican presidential candidates that the primaries mattered. Take 2008 as an example: Early on, there were a number of candidates tugging the party rightward—Mike Huckabee, notably, along with Alan Keyes and Ron Paul (except on foreign policy). But they lost. The primary voters nominated the one person, John McCain, who had through much of his career made a point of working with Democrats to pass stuff.Looked at in retrospect, 2008 turns out to have been a real hinge point, doesn’t it? If McCain had not allowed himself to be suckered into choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate and had trusted his instincts and taken someone with crossover appeal and won, we might have had a Republican Party that wouldn’t have been so susceptible to Donald Trump. (Mind you, I’m glad he lost, but it’s an interesting and somewhat poignant “what if.”)In a two-party presidential system, as opposed to a parliamentary system, the presidential primary process is the time when the parties, by selecting a standard-bearer from among several choices, tell voters: This is who we are; these are our ideals, this is what we stand for. As recently as 2012, Republicans were still telling the country that they hadn’t gone off the cliff’s edge—the party was increasingly dominated by extremists who couldn’t accept Barack Obama’s quite convincing 2008 victory, but its voters still nominated, in Mitt Romney, the most mainstream of their four major candidates. (That same year, Romney notched his then–record setting fourth win in the CPAC straw poll, if you want to recall a halcyon era when the annual conference of conservatives wasn’t a confab of fascist fanatics.)Then came Trump. Until then, the party, as extreme as it had become, still retained something of a superego, the brain’s critical and moralizing force that counters pure instinct. Open racism and calls for violence, for example, were still mostly verboten. But once Trump started talking about Mexican rapists and telling his crowds to “knock the crap out of” hecklers and suggesting that someone shoot Hillary Clinton, and the crowds responded the way they did, the superego was pulverized. It’s all id now.And so here we are. The party is a crime syndicate because it has enthusiastically placed at its head a man who talks and acts like a mob boss and who follows no rules and who, as we just learned last week,  in two years of his presidency from foreign governments doing business with his companies. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Mark Pomerantz, the prosecutor who was for a time pursuing Trump from the Manhattan district attorney’s office, compared Trump to John Gotti. , a former Trump administration official called the comparison “unfair to the late Mr. Gotti.”The entire party is in lockstep behind this, except for some holdouts such as Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, now drummed out of office for their trouble, and Romney, who is about to join them. Aside from these and maybe a few other occasional critics, we’ve seen an entire party wave away an insurrection, charges about sharing intelligence secrets with Mar-a-Lago buddies, sexual harassment, rape, and financial chicanery that would make  blush. This is a crime wave, and the “Party of Lincoln” is all for it.It’s a treasonous clique devoted to ending the USA as we’ve known it for reasons I barely need to spell out. The party already tried to end American democracy once, three years ago this past Sunday. Trump and other Republicans have said many times that they’re ready to do it again if they need to, and that they’ll finish the job this time. Remember, Marjorie Taylor Greene  that “if Steve Bannon and I had organized [January 6], we would have won. Not to mention, it would have been armed.” She later said she was joking. Right. Michael Luttig, the conservative former judge turned fierce Trump critic,  that what Trump tried in 2020 was just “a dry run” for 2024.Finally, the party has become an Orwellian disinformation machine, again for reasons that we all know. Take virtually anything any major Republican leader says; it’s almost certain to be not just false but a direct inversion of the truth put out for propaganda purposes. The “Biden crime family” is a good one. January 6 was a normal day of tourism. Biden stole the election. Democrats run up deficits. There are thousands. We have to endure eight more days of watching these people pretend they’re competing for a nomination, pretend they’re putting out a vision for a political party. It’s nonsense. These ersatz candidates are auditioning for chief of staff or secretary of state, and everyone knows it (except Ron DeSantis, who’s playing for 2028). Some commentators have been kind to Nikki Haley. She stands out from most of the field in that she is a competent politician and is not a maniac. She has recently turned up her criticisms of Trump, but she also praises him, and thus she’s not fundamentally challenging Trump or Trumpism. Only Chris Christie is doing that, and we see where he’s headed (the island of misfit Republicans, with Mitt Romney, in exile).The Republican Party turns 170 years old this coming March 20, a Wednesday. That will be the morning when, it’s 99 percent likely, we will wake up to see that Donald Trump has swept the Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, and Ohio primaries. As fate would have it, that is the precise moment when Trump’s team  it expects he will seal the nomination numerically. Other than that, Mr. Lincoln, how do you like your party today?</p>

    <h1>Biden’s Pro-Democracy Message Needs Work</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Mon, 08 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Joe Biden wants the 2024 presidential election to be a  of American democracy. It’s not hard to see why. There is an existential threat embedded in this contest, as the likely Republican nominee is someone who has already tried to subvert American democracy once and who has spent the last several years campaigning on  he started on January 6, 2021. But there’s a second dynamic in play for Biden as well. A laser focus on democracy is a clean way to get around the  that have caused Biden’s poll numbers to plummet, namely around his advanced age and the somewhat halting way he has delivered a promised return to normalcy. Voters may long for someone better than Biden—and, based on polling from the last two years, they clearly crave some fresh blood, even if that merely means “generic Democrat” at the moment. Still, those concerns should pale next to the threat posed by Trump (who, for what it’s worth, voters also do not like at all). Elections are about contrasts, and on Friday Biden officially launched his 2024 campaign by laying out a stark one: Donald Trump is hell-bent on destroying American democracy; Joe Biden, like him or not, is there to protect it. “When the attacks of January 6 happened, there was no doubt about the truth. At the time, even Republican members of Congress and Fox News commentators publicly and privately condemned the attack. And as one Republican senator said, Trump’s behavior was embarrassing and humiliating for the country,” Biden . “But now as time has gone on, politics, fear, money have all intervened, and those MAGA voices who know the truth about Trump and January 6 have abandoned the truth and abandoned our democracy. They’ve made their choice. Now the rest of us—Democrats, independents, mainstream Republicans—we have to make our choice. I know mine, and I believe I know America’s.”It was a strong, impassioned speech. It was also the exact rhetoric The New Republic’s editor, Michael Tomasky, argued that Biden should be using, , until November—the idea being that a larger plan to foreground the threat posed by the former president “will have [voters] terrified at the prospect of Trump getting back into the White House.” Making the case that Trump is a risk not worth taking the primary focus of a campaign has a mixed record of success—it worked in 2020, as well as the 2022 midterms; it failed notably in 2016. Still, why not take your shot? As campaign arguments go, it has the advantage of being both politically salient and, best of all, true. But while Trump will certainly spend most of the next 10 months—whether or not he is the Republican presidential nominee, which he almost certainly will be—saying inflammatory and fascistic things, I worry that this argument won’t be enough on its own to sustain Biden’s bid. He is currently in need of a positive and proactive argument as well. If Biden is going to assert that democracy must be saved—and that, by extension, he is its savior—he needs to make the case that he is a worthy and capable protector of it. Thus far, he hasn’t explicitly filled in these blanks. Moreover, the pro-democracy message does nothing to address Biden’s biggest vulnerability: that he may not be not up to the task of being president for four more years. It’s worth remembering that Biden’s core argument in 2020 wasn’t simply that he was a saner and more stable figure than Donald Trump: It was that he could restore a sense of competence and stability to a government that had been rattled by years of turbulence. The Covid-19 pandemic has receded as a political issue—just —but its prominence was central to Biden’s pitch to voters. In 2020, he successfully argued that Trump’s chaotic approach to governance was making an already devastating pandemic worse and that he could bring back a sense of normalcy. Above all else, however, Biden’s 2020 candidacy was built around a simple pitch: He alone could make America boring again after several years rocked by constant chaos, nonstop tweeting, and a once-in-a-century pandemic. It was a choice between the crazy spectacle of a bull rampaging through a china shop and—well … just the china shop.It was a good pitch! More importantly, it was one that made Biden’s greatest liability—he became the oldest president-elect ever—into an asset. Biden had experience and, despite his penchant for gaffes, enough gravitas to make the case that he was a steady, trusted hand. Voters were ready for a break from tweet barrages at every hour of the day and night and ready to settle for a duller, more predictable candidate. No, Biden wasn’t going to be an exciting, electrifying president, but he might be one that you didn’t have to think about several times a day. Biden has, in many ways, kept that promise. His administration has produced a bevy of  built around infrastructure spending that make him arguably the most accomplished Democratic president since Lyndon B. Johnson. Amid a series of unforeseen geopolitical crises, his administration’s response has been—for better and, more recently, for worse—to double down on existing alliances. There have been no actual political scandals to speak of (though there have been several manufactured ones), a noted contrast to the previous four years.  But Biden’s image as a steady, competent figure has been damaged, perhaps irrevocably. His poll numbers began to dip after the first geopolitical crisis, the fallout from the . Perceptions of Biden’s age—he is both the oldest president in American history and has had several physical and verbal stumbles in recent years—have . He has not been aided by factors outside of his control: He could hardly be blamed for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, both of which have understandably given the impression of a world on the brink of chaos. Chaos within the Republican Party as well as its efforts to generate pseudo-scandals have, moreover, damaged Biden’s ability to sell himself as someone who can transcend partisan rancor. Biden’s troubles recall those that beset Barack Obama during his first term, when Republican obstruction and intransigence dinged his image as an agent of hope, change, and political renewal. But Obama could rely on youth and vigor to aid his response. Biden lacks these reservoirs of political potency, but he can still look to Obama’s successful reelection campaign as a roadmap: His former boss combined attacks on Mitt Romney’s plutocratic domestic program with a robust defense of his first term, to handily win despite an underperforming economy, as inspiration. For now, impassioned calls to protect democracy are a fine opening argument. But his campaign needs to acknowledge the growing concern over the president’s competence and reassure voters that his well-meaning intentions will be matched by a truly strong and stable grip on the rudder of our Republic that people can believe in. </p>

    <h1>Ohio’s GOP Governor Vetoed an Anti-Trans Bill. Then He Made It Worse.</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 21:56:01 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed an executive order on Friday that will immediately ban gender-affirming surgeries for minors within the state, making Ohio the second state in the nation to ban the procedure. DeWine’s decision comes about a week after the Republican governor  that would have banned all gender-affirming care for minors, from surgeries to hormone blockers. But then, after the rest of his party threatened to override his veto, DeWine did something unexpected. He went above and beyond the original bill, restricting some access to gender-affirming care for adults as well.Under the new set of administrative rules, both minors and adults seeking any gender-affirming care will require sign-offs by multidisciplinary teams. That team could include (but is not limited to) an endocrinologist, a bioethicist, and a psychiatrist, DeWine explained during a news conference on Friday. The new rules will be enforced by the Ohio Department of Health and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.“Candidly, which I expressed a week ago, I am concerned that there could be fly-by-night providers, clinics that might be dispensing medication to adults with no counseling and no basic standards to assure quality care,” DeWine said.Trans adults will also have to undergo a “lengthy” period of mental health counseling before seeking care.The new steep barrier of entry—which is not required in most states across the nation—will likely tack on incredible medical expenses, only further limiting access to what is often viewed as lifesaving care for transgender individuals.Watch as Ohio Governor Mike DeWine proposes Adult trans restrictions, including "lengthy" waiting periods, and a team including a "endocrinologist, bioethicist, and psychiatrist."These restrictions would all but eliminate trans care, slowing it to a trickle. — Erin Reed (@ErinInTheMorn) It’s not clear why DeWine suddenly had a change of heart and decided to expand restrictions on gender-affirming care to Ohioans of all ages.Last week, DeWine spoke in support of trans rights, saying he heard the cries of parents with transgender children before making the decision to veto the previous Republican bill.“I’ll never forget what so many of them told me. They said, ‘Governor, but for this, my child would be dead by now. My child would have committed suicide,” DeWine told local news outlet .</p>

    <h1>Here Are the Seven Most Heinous Things Wayne LaPierre Said as NRA Leader</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 20:49:41 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Wayne LaPierre  Friday as head of the , after more than 30 years at the powerful gun lobby’s helm.Although LaPierre cited health reasons, his exit—scheduled for the end of the month—comes as he and three other current and former NRA leaders face trial for a  from New York Attorney General Letitia James. James accused the group in 2020 of violating nonprofit laws and misusing millions of dollars from the NRA to pay for extravagant lifestyles for themselves.Here’s a look back at seven of the most outlandish things LaPierre has said.1. He said the only thing that can stop a shooter is more guns.Just one week after the tragic  elementary school shooting in 2012, LaPierre  that there was no point in trying to pass restrictions on gun access. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he said.2. He said gun restrictions won’t stop school shootings.“We can’t lose precious time debating legislation that won’t work,” he  in his post–Sandy Hook speech. “I call on Congress today to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed officers in every single school in this nation.”But as the country saw almost a decade later, the presence of police officers on campus did not prevent the shootings in Parkland, Florida, or , Texas.3. He said women are only free if they can own a gun.During the 2016 presidential campaign, LaPierre  that Hillary Clinton didn’t actually care about women because she supported gun control laws.“All of America’s women, you aren’t free if you aren’t free to defend yourself,” he said. “If President Obama, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else denies you that right, they don’t really care about you at all.”4. He said guns are necessary because “Latin American gangs” have taken over the U.S.In a 2013 op-ed for The Daily Caller, widely criticized for its racist undertones, LaPierre justified gun rights on the premise that “Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States.” Blaming Latin American immigrants, or gangs, was a popular talking point for LaPierre. In 2018, just a week after the  shooting, LaPierre  xenophobia as he accused Democrats of passing ineffective laws.“Their laws don’t stop illegal criminals from crossing our borders every single day,” he said, as if gun control was thus completely unnecessary.5. He did not see the irony of his own words.“It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewelry store of some Hollywood gala,” LaPierre  during that 2018 speech, not seeming to realize he had just advocated for gun control.6. He pushed antisemitic conspiracy theories.In the same speech, LaPierre  on a favorite Republican talking point: blaming prominent  for the world’s problems. He claimed that socialism was on the rise in the U.S. thanks to “the social engineering and the billions of people like George Soros and Michael Bloomberg.”7. He said all pro-gun control politicians should be afraid to go to bed at night.The NRA’s annual 2023 convention took place in April, on the anniversary of one of the  mass shootings in the city’s history and just weeks after two major mass shootings in , Tennessee, and , Kentucky.During his speech, LaPierre issued a casual threat. “Gun-hating politicians should never go to bed unafraid of what this association and all of our millions of members can do to their political careers,” he  to cheers from the crowd.</p>

    <h1>Florida Officially Has the Signatures to Put Abortion on the Ballot</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 19:19:04 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Florida abortion advocates got  on Friday to putting access to the procedure on the  in November, even as Republicans continue to try and block them.Advocates needed to collect at least 891,523 valid signatures before February 1 to get the measure on the ballot. As of Friday, the  has verified 911,112 signatures—and more could come. Floridians Protecting Freedom, the group that helped organize the statewide signature collection, says they have  1.4 million signatures.The amendment would allow abortion access up until viability, or when the fetus can survive outside the uterus. This is generally estimated to happen at around 24 weeks.Florida currently bans abortion after 15 weeks. That law went before the state Supreme Court in September. If the court upholds the law, then an even more restrictive measure banning abortion at six weeks—before most people know they are pregnant—will go into effect. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis  the hugely unpopular bill in April.If the abortion amendment makes it onto the ballot, then it has a strong chance of . Florida requires 60 percent of voters to support amending the state constitution. A February study by the  found that 64 percent of Floridians believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases—more than enough to defeat the state’s minimum threshold. In fact, a good chunk of the petition signatures came from .That has Republican leaders running scared. State Attorney General Ashley Moody, a DeSantis ally, has  the Florida Supreme Court to disqualify the amendment. She argues the language is misleading, claiming that the use of the word “viability” could have multiple meanings. The state’s high court will hear arguments on February 7.In November, state Republican Representative Rick Roth quietly introduced a  to raise the threshold for ballot initiatives to 66.7 percent of votes—just above the definite level of support for abortion access in Florida. The measure has not left the committee, and it’s unclear how far it will actually go. Roth  a similar measure in 2022 that easily passed the state House, but it failed in the Senate.But even if Roth’s bill fails again, it’s a sign of just how far Republicans are willing to go to block people from voting on abortion access. Ballot initiatives have led to multiple major abortion rights wins, even in otherwise . Since  was overturned, multiple Republican-led states have put the question of abortion on the ballot—and every single time, voters choose to .</p>

    <h1>New York Attorney General Wants to Hit Trump Where It Hurts</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 19:00:38 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> New York Attorney General Letitia James asked the judge overseeing Donald Trump’s  to penalize the former president to the tune of $370 million on Friday—$120 million more than originally requested—arguing that Trump showed on the stand he had gained that much through unlawful conduct.James is also requesting that the real estate mogul receive what could potentially prove the most costly penalty of them all: a total ban from participating in New York’s real estate market.The penalty request came in a post-trial brief filed Friday by the New York attorney general, who sued Trump for $250 million in 2022 for overinflating his net worth to obtain favorable bank loans.Attorneys will make their closing arguments in the trial next week. Trump’s bank fraud trial has regularly  since it began in earnest in September 2023, mainly thanks to his inflammatory social media posts about Judge Arthur Engoron and his staff, which resulted in harassment of Engoron’s law clerks and a stunning  and several fines against the former president.Engoron has said he will try to issue a ruling on the case by the end of the month.</p>

    <h1>Florida Republicans Introduce the Most Terrifying Assault on Trans Rights Yet</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 18:09:44 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Florida is on the precipice of its latest prohibition against the LGBTQ community, this time proposing legislation that would end  of trans persons living in the state. The bill would also effectively cease the issuance of driver’s licenses to trans people—unless they comply with signing a “biological sex affidavit” that confirms their sex assigned at birth.Should the bill pass the state government’s Republican trifecta, it would effectively force all trans Floridians to carry documentation that outs them, even if it contradicts identifying documents from other states or the federal government—like passports or birth certificates—that may recognize a person’s preferred gender.“The department may not issue an original or replacement driver license or identification card that specifies a person’s sex as different from that specified on the person’s original certificate of live birth,” reads . “The department must require an applicant to sign an affidavit certifying that the sex specified on the application submitted for a new or replacement driver license or identification card is identical to that specified on the applicant’s original certificate of live birth,” it continues. “If the applicant determines that the applicant made a false attestation, the department must revoke his or her driver license or identification card.”Florida has introduced a bill that would invalidate all drivers licenses issued to trans people. It would require trans people to carry drivers licenses that out them regardless if it is inconsistent with identity documents such as passports, birth certificates, etc. — Alejandra Caraballo (@Esqueer_) The bill, introduced by Florida Representative Dean Black, also seeks to change the legal definition of “sex” and “gender” in such a way that excludes trans identities from all state legislation, and requires all vital statistics collected by the state to match a person’s sex assigned at birth, effectively making it impossible to track hate crimes against trans people in the Sunshine State.Despite the fact that anti-trans legislation does nothing for a populace other than restrict the rights of an already marginalized group of people, Florida’s government has been on a tirade to choke and chip away at every iota of aid and comfort available to the trans community—which, by the way, constitutes just 5 percent of all young people in America and collectively less than 2 percent of the U.S. population over the age of 30, according to data by the .In November, Florida Representative Ryan Chamberlin proposed a  that would abolish LGBTQ nonprofits, prohibiting the distribution of state funds to any contractor or organization that considers an individual’s gender identity or sexual orientation. It is currently in committee.And in 2022, the state angered educators across the nation by enacting a restrictive “” law, which made it illegal for elementary school and later high school teachers in Florida public schools to mention sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom.</p>

    <h1>Here’s the Proof That Team Trump Directly Helped Michigan’s Fake Electors</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 17:46:22 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Donald Trump’s campaign team actively helped organize the scheme to use fake electors to falsely claim he won Michigan during the 2020 election.Internal campaign emails obtained by  reveal just how extensive Trump’s involvement was in the plot. The messages show Trump’s campaign staff helped organize the state Republican Party meeting that resulted in the fake electors. Trump’s team also tried to mail the document falsely certifying he had won Michigan to then–Vice President Mike Pence and the National Archives.Joe Biden  Michigan in 2020 with 50.6 percent of the vote. When it became clear he would lose, a Trump campaign employee allegedly tried to  at the TCF Center in Detroit, where ballots were being counted, to stop the vote count.After Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, Republicans in Michigan and six other highly contested states launched attempts to overturn the results. GOP operatives signed certificates falsely stating they were the state’s Electoral College representatives and tried to claim that Trump had won their state.Michigan Republican leaders publicly insisted the fake electors were just there to ensure that Trump could be certified as president in a timely manner should the courts overturn the 2020 election. Every single one of Trump’s legal challenges to the election were thrown out.But the recently revealed campaign emails show that Trump lawyer , who came up with the fake elector plan, told Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn that the actual goal was to boost the conspiracy the election had been rigged. Doing so could eventually “void the results” showing Biden had won.Trump lawyer , who took over the plan from Chesebro, explained separately that “if Biden is simply held to under 270 by virtue of electoral votes not being counted (even though ‘appointed’), or by virtue of a switch to legislature-certified electors, then the election gets thrown to the House.” “If the Republicans there hold true and vote with their state delegations, Trump should win a bare majority of the states.”In addition to helping organize the fake elector scheme, Trump’s campaign staff also took it upon themselves to get the fake certificate to Washington. Emails show that campaign staffer Shawn Flynn led the meeting on December 14, 2020, during which the fake electors signed a certificate. Flynn was also in charge of mailing the certificate to Pence, who oversaw the electoral vote count.When Flynn asked if he should pick a certain mailing class, Trump’s director of Election Day operations, Mike Roman, replied, “Choose the fastest.”But it soon became unclear whether the certificate would make it. The fake documents from Michigan and Wisconsin got stuck in the mail, and Trump campaign staffers  to fly the certificates to Washington themselves. They even considered chartering a private jet to make it in time to block the legitimate certification.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel  16 people in July with felonies for pretending to be 2020 electors. The accused include state Republican Party Co-chair Meshawn Maddock and state Republican National Committeewoman Kathy Berden.Three states have issued charges for fake elector schemes. Nevada  six Republicans, including the state GOP chair, in early December. In Georgia, the Fulton County district attorney has charged some fake electors as part of her larger  against Trump. The former president and his allies have been  in the Peach State for trying to overturn the 2020 election results.There is also an investigation into the fake elector scheme in Arizona. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as fake electors  a lawsuit over their actions in December. Under the agreement, the Republicans acknowledged that Biden had won the state and promised not to serve as electors in 2024 or any other election where Trump is on the ballot.The other states where Republicans tried to overthrow the results—New York and Pennsylvania—have yet to publicly announce whether they will probe the fake elector plot.</p>

    <h1>Republican Congressman Complains His Party Has “Nothing” to Campaign On</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 16:23:12 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> If Congress doesn’t work out for Representative Andy Biggs, he may have a future writing campaign ads … for Democrats. The Arizona Republican admitted his party has accomplished “nothing” while in control of the House.During a Thursday appearance on Newsmax, Biggs acknowledged the “embarrassing” truth: The GOP hasn’t managed to get anything done since taking control of the House of Representatives in 2022.“We have nothing, in my opinion, we have nothing to go out there and campaign on, Chris!” Biggs told host Chris Salcedo. “It’s embarrassing!”Salcedo echoed the sentiment: “The Republican Party in the congressional majority has zero accomplishments.”Biggs: We have nothing to campaign on. It’s embarrassing Salcedo: The Republican Majority has zero accomplishments — Acyn (@Acyn) The 118th Congress has  just two dozen bills in its two-year session. Previous congresses have typically passed between 300 and 450 laws. Even when Republicans controlled both chambers under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, those sessions still managed to pass more than 70 laws.Most of the current congressional session has been taken up instead by Republican in-fighting that resulted in two separate tortuous rounds of voting for a speaker. First in  for Kevin McCarthy and then again in  after McCarthy was ousted for making too many deals with Democrats.Biggs is partially to blame for the lack of accomplishments, though. A member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, Biggs  McCarthy for speaker, contributing to the dragged-out chamber vote.Biggs has   budget bills, claiming he wants to decrease government spending but really helping push the U.S. dangerously close to a  multiple times over the course of 2023. He also  to oust McCarthy as speaker, plunging the House into chaos as the chamber scrambled to elect a new leader.This is now at least the second time a Republican has publicly called out the GOP for getting nothing done. Texas Representative Chip Roy  his colleagues in November during a House session.“One thing. I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing. One. That I can go campaign on and say we did,” Roy said. “One!”“Anybody sitting in the complex, if you want to come down to the floor and come explain to me one material, meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done besides well, ‘I guess it’s not as bad as the Democrats.’”</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” brand apparently worked so well for the former president’s prospects that his campaign has decided to use it again, this time copying and pasting the phrase into a GOP primary flier.But now, Trump has a new target: Ron DeSantis.The flier, which flooded mailboxes in Iowa, accuses DeSantis of attempting to “rig” the Iowa GOP primary.“Stop the fraud. Reject DeSantis on January 15,” the flier reads, including a quote from Trump that claims, “When you swamp them with enough votes, there’s a point at which they can only cheat so much.”The charge stems from an interview in which DeSantis’s wife, Casey DeSantis,  from around the nation to help their cause, claiming that “you do not have to be a resident of Iowa to be able to participate in the caucus,” though “participate” does not necessarily translate to “vote.”Trump campaign out with a mailer in Iowa accusing DeSantis of trying to rig the caucuses  by   — Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) The baseless accusation of more voter fraud comes as a sign of weakness, not strength, as Trump prepares to square up against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the fast-approaching Republican primary. While Trump has led his competitors by a startling margin since the campaign began—and by nearly  at the time of publication—the pair do pose a serious if unconventional threat, particularly as the former president  with several states  from the GOP ballot entirely on the basis of violating the U.S. Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment. </p>

    <h1>Americans Don’t Care About Democracy? Well, Democrats—Make Them Care</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 15:32:09 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> President Biden will give what they’re billing as the first speech of his reelection campaign today, and in it, he will attack Donald Trump by name as a historic threat to democracy. An aide  that Biden “is going to be very straightforward on what happened, the truth of what happened, and the role that Trump played in that.”The speech will arrive, as we approach the third anniversary of the insurrection, in about as bleak a context as we could imagine. Trump  in most head-to-head polls, albeit just by a point or two. And Republicans are apparently rallying to Trump. A  released earlier this week had some gob-smacking findings showing that Republicans are far less concerned about January 6 than they were right after it happened, and they weren’t very bothered then. We’re in a surreal hall of mirrors. Trump  legal defeat after legal defeat. He’s being  state ballots. His lawyer  he led an insurrection. A new House report  nearly $8 million he made from foreign governments while serving as president. And for now, none of it matters.This campaign will be about a lot of things, as all campaigns are. But the main question will come down to this and this alone: Will a majority or plurality of Americans use their vote—that is, employ the peaceful means of democracy’s most essential right—to put a violent fascist back in charge of this country?That the answer isn’t a clear “no” is terrifying. But here’s the thing. Some would argue that the fact that the answer isn’t a clear “no” means that Biden and Democrats shouldn’t emphasize the issue because it’s not a clear winner. I say the opposite is the case. Emphasize the issue and make it a winner. If polls today show that not enough people care about democracy, don’t just follow the polls. Change the polls. Make them care.Republicans understand this dynamic and have for years. The classic recent example is the Iraq War. After the 9/11 attacks, no one outside a handful of neoconservatives thought they justified waging war on Iraq. But over the course of 2002, the Bush White House changed public opinion. They did it largely through lies, but they did it. By the time the United States invaded Iraq, majorities supported it.Trump has changed polls too. Pre-Trump Republicans believed a lot of bad things, and I’m certainly not sugar-coating that GOP—which, after all, laid down and gave itself over to Trump. But they did still believe in the general integrity of the American electoral system. No one was urging Mitt Romney to dispute the 2012 election results. Romney  (or very early Wednesday morning, technically), and everyone moved on. But by 2016, Trump was saying that he would respect the results “if I win.” And that was all it took. The polls, at least among Republicans, changed and changed dramatically.Democrats historically don’t do this. When the polls are on their side—as when, for example, George W. Bush tried to privatize Social Security in 2005—they’re as swashbuckling as Blackbeard. (That was one case where the GOP/right-wing media onslaught failed conspicuously to change the polls.) But when the polls aren’t on their side, they’re about as swashbuckling as Caspar Milquetoast.If they want to make this democracy argument—and I think they’re right to do so—and if they want to win it—and they must—this habit has to change. They need to be mapping out a plan now that stage by stage will lay out an argument to voters (swing voters especially) that by Election Day will have them terrified at the prospect of Trump getting back into the White House. This can, and must, start with January 6. But then, by late spring say, and especially by the fall, the argument should be almost entirely about the future. Attack ad after attack ad simply need to take Trump’s own words, and the words of his people in leaks to media outlets, about how they’re going to impose authoritarianism in his second term. I would anticipate too that, by the fall, Trump will have said as much many times on the hustings, handing the Democrats fresh and irrefutable fodder.Obviously there are other things the Democrats need to do. They are positioned to win millions of votes on the question of abortion rights. They have to press an economic argument the best they can, and as I , if some economic predictions are right, that could be less of a challenge than it seems like it will be today.But there is a deep moral and ethical question at the center of this election unlike any other of my lifetime. Will Americans use the tools of democracy to hand their country to a democracy destroyer? They won’t if Democrats refuse to accept the “people don’t care about democracy” argument and make them care. </p>

    <h1>Nikki Haley Really Just Used the “Black Friends” Card to Defend Herself</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 15:20:41 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley tried to explain away her recent failure to mention slavery when describing the cause of the Civil War and instead used one of the oldest “I’m not racist” lines in the book.Last month, Haley  slavery when asked about the cause of the Civil War, but during Thursday night’s town hall, she said it’s only because she grew up in the South, where slavery doesn’t need to be mentioned. Also, she used to have a lot of Black friends growing up.“Chris Christie, though, said you came out and gave that answer not because you’re in his words ‘dumb or racist,’ but because you’re unwilling to offend anyone by telling the truth. What do you say to that?” CNN anchor Erin Burnett asked Haley, referring to her recent Civil War gaffe.“What I will tell you is that Chris Christie is from New Jersey,” Haley said after commenting that she’s never afraid to offend. “I should have said slavery right off the bat, but if you grow up in South Carolina, literally in second and third grade you learn about slavery. You grow up and you have—you know, I had Black friends growing up. It’s a very talked about thing. We have a big history in South Carolina when it comes to, you know, slavery, when it comes to all the things that happen with the Civil War, all that.”“I was over—I was thinking past slavery and talking about the lesson that we would learn going forward,” the former U.N. ambassador added. “I shouldn’t have done that.”Asked about her Civil War/slavery comments debacle, Haley says "I had Black friends going up." — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) “I knew half of South Carolinians saw the Confederate flag as heritage and tradition. The other half of South Carolinians saw it as slavery and hate. My job wasn’t to judge either side,” Haley continued, noting that “a leader doesn’t decide who’s right.”The defense mode train of thought comes after a controversial campaign town hall held in North Conway, New Hampshire, last month, where the typically expedient politico stumbled and fumbled her way through answering what would better be likened to a middle school quiz question than a real stumper.“What was the cause of the United States Civil War?” asked one audience member.“Well, don’t come with an easy question,” the former South Carolina governor threw back before embarking on a response that made even Florida Governor Ron DeSantis comment “.”“I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn’t do,” Haley said at the time.“I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,” Haley added. “And I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn’t need to tell you how to live your life. They don’t need to tell you what you can and can’t do. They don’t need to be a part of your life.”Recent polling numbers have suggested that Haley could prove quite a challenge to the former president’s bid for the White House. A recent survey out of New Hampshire by the  predicted a Trump GOP primary win by a margin of just four percent—currying 37 percent of the Republican vote against potential runner-up Nikki Haley with 33 percent.</p>

    <h1>Trump Lawyer Has a Not So Subtle Warning for Brett Kavanaugh</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 15:00:47 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Donald Trump’s lawyer  appeared to suggest that certain Supreme Court justices owe her former boss for their jobs and should therefore rule in his favor.Habba, who seems to have a  of saying things that are bad for the legitimacy of Trump’s case, appeared on Fox News Thursday night to discuss Trump being  from the Colorado and Maine 2024 primary ballots. Trump has appealed the Maine decision, an indication he intends to take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.“I think it should be a slam dunk in the Supreme Court. I have faith in them,” Habba told host Sean Hannity. “People like Kavanaugh, who the president fought for, who the president went through hell to get into place. He’ll step up, those people will step up.”“Not because they’re pro-Trump, but because they’re pro-law, because they’re pro-fairness. And the law on this is very clear.”Habba: I think it should be a slam dunk in the supreme court. I have faith in them. You know, people like Kavanaugh, who the president fought for, who the president went through hell to get into place. He'll step up. — Acyn (@Acyn) Habba was referring specifically to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose confirmation hearing was rocked by multiple sexual assault allegations. After a lengthy process, made  by coming so soon after the #MeToo movement began, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court. Trump did not actually do anything to help Kavanaugh except  a lot on X, formerly Twitter.As for Habba’s claim that the “law on this is very clear,” it actually isn’t. That’s why the Supreme Court might need to weigh in on the issue of Trump’s eligibility.Trump was  from the primary ballots in Colorado and Maine after the  and  determined in December that he had engaged in insurrection and was therefore constitutionally ineligible to run for president. Dozens of  are either ongoing or already decided in other states—and some of the outcomes have been the complete opposite. The secretaries of state in Michigan, Minnesota, and California have all determined that Trump will remain on their presidential ballots.Multiple legal scholars have urged the justices to resolve the issue and provide a single rule for all states, instead of having a messy mix of some state ballots with Trump’s name and some without. It’s unclear how the Supreme Court will rule, though. Many of the justices, including some appointed by Trump, are hardline textualists and  that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to Trump, disqualifying him.</p>

    <h1>How to Be Hopeful Going Into 2024</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Twenty-one species were finally, after much deliberation, declared  in the United States last year. Only 11 other species had been declared extinct in the prior half-century. 2023 was the warmest year ever recorded for Earth’s average temperature. Some researchers think . The Biden administration  auctioning off oil-drilling leases on December 20—part of  on Democrats’ watch. By the end of 2024, the country could be preparing for another Trump presidency—likely gutting environmental protections and re-withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement.Yet perhaps counterintuitively, an emerging theme as 2023 closed out and made way for 2024 was that of hope. “Here’s How Bad Climate Change Will Get in the U.S.—and Why There’s Still Hope,” was how  announced the results of the Fifth National Climate Assessment in November. “Hope is a discipline,”  one Guardian headline published New Year’s Eve atop an interview with Nathan Baring, one of the young plaintiffs suing the U.S. government for having “willfully ignored” warnings about fossil fuels. (The case was filed in 2015 and still hasn’t gone to trial.) And then there’s Hannah Ritchie’s book Not the End of the World, being released next week to notable press interest. Ritchie argues in interviews in  and  this week that, while “it has been an incredibly bad year,” we’ve made more progress than we sometimes acknowledge on climate change, and reframing existential dread as “How can I try to contribute to accelerating the good outpacing the bad?” may be more productive.Hope is a good thing. Climate “doomerism,” numerous writers have pointed out, is destructive—giving people the   that there’s nothing left to fight for, when in reality “” matters for communities, species, food systems, and livelihoods. To put it another way: As a practical matter it’s hard for humans to mobilize at either an individual or a collective level when they feel hopeless, and as a scientific matter, portraying the future as a dead-end done deal isn’t accurate.Hope is searingly politically relevant, and also complicated: The politics of hope run directly  to the politics of fear, which have a  of empowering regressive nationalist and racist movements. But hope can also be abused. There is a rich history among rich nations of pushing fossil fuel phaseout ever further into the future, hoping that  will suck carbon out of the air and take care of the problem for us.Nor can hope alone, as TNR’s Kate Aronoff argued in a , be expected to fix our dysfunctional climate politics:On one hand, it’s understandable that climate advocates would think about the best way to communicate about climate change. On the other, fixating on finding the perfect tone for climate communication mistakes messaging and mindset for a theory of change. Getting off fossil fuels requires replacing the lifeblood of capitalism on a stunningly quick timeline, and replacing it with alternatives just now coming into their own. Doing that isn’t so much an issue of pessimism or optimism but of political economy…. The reason there is now a “rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,” per the latest IPCC report, isn’t because some ill-defined mass of climate-concerned people has been insufficiently hopeful in public. It’s because the people who want to pass adequate climate policies have significantly less power and money than the people who want to obstruct such policies.This last sentence points to another thing worth remembering: Hope probably shouldn’t be used as a substitute for accountability. A lot of companies have made a lot of money cooking the planet. They , and they funded misinformation campaigns to keep citizens and their governments from intervening to stop them. And while one could argue that fixating on blame can be counterproductive, naming and blaming could be very helpful if it means people  with or do the lobbying and marketing for the entities that got us here. Cultural shifts are important for political change. Then, too, the money needed to save the world has to come from somewhere: Making major polluters pay to clean up the mess is a good start.As we begin the new year, I like reading these hopeful pieces. I also wonder how they will age: whether editors like me will be greenlighting hopeful pieces a year from now or whether the prospect of a second Trump administration will blitz all this climate discourse into oblivion. Hope doesn’t mean a lot without action, and the precise causal relationship between the two can be tricky to unpack (as a multitude of widely circulated aphorisms ). Let’s hope 2024 goes well. Let’s not count on it.Good News/Bad NewsElectric vehicles just got more affordable: You can now get instant rebates on electric vehicles rather than waiting until tax-filing time, thanks to a change in federal incentives that .The Great Lakes came into 2024 with the .Stat of the Week305 days… until Election Day 2024, the  of which could have a   on U.S. climate policy, emissions, and climate change around the world.What I’m ReadingThe fees levied on irrigation in California’s bountiful Pajaro Valley are working, offering hope that similar systems could help address the West’s water crisis, as well as water crises across the U.S. and in fact all over the globe.Experts from as far away as China and Egypt are traveling to the valley to study the system. But replicating it elsewhere could face major challenges. For one thing, “People don’t like taxes,” said Nicholas Brozovic, an agricultural economist at the University of Nebraska. “There’s nothing mysterious about that.” New research on the program revealed a direct connection between paying for the groundwater and conserving it: A 20 percent increase in the price of groundwater has resulted in a 20 percent decrease in the extraction of groundwater.  One reason experts see Pajaro as a model: Despite the high price of water, agriculture in the region is thriving.

    <h1>The Electric Kool-Aid Conservative</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> 1987 was arguably the year Donald Trump became Donald Trump. While he’d been one the most famous and outspoken men in New York for nearly a decade by then, the publication of The Art of the Deal—his ghostwritten guide to success—made him a household name and a fixture on television. That December, he appeared on CNN’s Crossfire to celebrate himself and field  from hosts Pat Buchanan and Tom Braden befitting his standing as an icon of American business. What do you intend to do next as a billionaire? Will you give to charities and causes? Might you run for president?Late in the show, Buchanan asks Trump what might have been the interview’s most difficult question: “Who are your favorite authors?” “Tom Wolfe is excellent,” he replies. Had he read The Bonfire of the Vanities?“I did not.”“What book are you reading now?” Braden chimes in.“I’m reading my own book again because I think it’s so fantastic, Tom.”“What’s the best book you’ve read beside Art of the Deal?” Buchanan asks.“I really like Tom Wolfe’s last book. And I think he’s a great author. He’s done a beautiful job —”“Which book?”“His current book.”“Bonfire of the Vanities.”“Yes. And the man has done a very, very good job.”While it’s comically difficult to tell from this exchange whether Trump really read The Bonfire of the Vanities, it’s also entirely plausible that he did—alongside , it was one of the year’s bestselling and most talked about books. And part of the appeal to Trump might have been that it is substantially about the world he inhabited—a satire filleting go-getting Manhattanites with money to burn and a deep fear of the city’s minority underclass.But it’s just as plausible that Trump never actually touched it. Bonfire was, after all, a book many purchased as a signifier or accessory—talked about enough in the press that one could easily pretend to have at least picked it over, a conversation piece for a living room table or the crook of one’s arm on the subway. It was, in short, the kind of status marker the book was written, at least in part, to mock and critique.That was to be expected—it was, after all, the first novel by another one of New York’s most famous and outspoken men. And while Tom Wolfe’s profile has diminished in the years since his death in 2018, things are looking up for the legacy of the man in white. His second novel, , will soon be a Netflix series—just a few years after his book , already the source material for an Academy Award–winning 1983 film, was adapted for television. Wolfe also happens to be the subject of the slender and not so satisfying new documentary, , directed by Richard Dewey, which holds few surprises for the viewers likeliest to seek out such a film—those who already know Wolfe’s work and persona well. The wit in white with the whiz-bang prose, a pioneering literary journalist of American lifestyles who found late success, as well as scorn, by writing a journalist’s approximation of literature—this is the Wolfe that emerges from the film and the worshipful 2015 profile by Michael Lewis it is based on, and the image of Wolfe likely to endure in the public imagination.Yet Wolfe was also, in essence, a theorist of American life—his work was informed by a body of ideas that his pop cultural status has largely obscured, and that he himself downplayed throughout his life. The Wolfe that emerges when one takes those ideas seriously isn’t a “radical” in any meaningful sense, but he is rather more interesting. Behind the ellipses and exclamation points and between the lines of his prose, a lively though often lazy conservative mind was at work, making sense of the half-century that birthed our garish and dismal present, Trump and all.Tom Wolfe was born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1930. His father, an agricultural scientist, was the editor of a magazine called The Southern Planter, which piqued his interest in writing. He enjoyed what was by all accounts a stable and comfortable childhood, and was raised, Lewis tells viewers in Radical Wolfe, to admire “athletes and war heroes.” He especially came to admire folk icons from the South, like Junior Johnson, an ex-bootlegger and one of stock car racing’s earliest superstars, whom Wolfe  “The Last American Hero” in a 1965 piece for Esquire that helped raise NASCAR’s national profile. “He’s drawing the attention of blue America to red America,” Lewis says in the segment on Johnson. In fact, the South was solidly Democratic and thus “blue” in contemporary terms at midcentury, but the inattentive viewer will get Lewis’s point.As the film tells it, when Wolfe—this affable and earnest cultural ambassador, straight from Dixie—entered Yale’s Ph.D. program in American studies in 1952, he immediately got the cold shoulder from the sons of the East’s elites. “He gets to Yale and all of a sudden he realizes there are all these people who kind of look down on the world he came from,” Lewis says. “But he had such a deep love of where he was from that he started to develop a mild contempt for the people around him.” That contempt eventually found an outlet in his Ph.D. thesis—a study of the League of American Writers in the 1930s, written from what Lewis calls “a vaguely right wing perspective,” though the film only lingers on this interesting tidbit briefly. The experience of writing the thesis and the criticism it received, we’re told, soured Wolfe on academia and sent him toward his first gigs as a reporter. In 1962, after stints at Springfield, Massachusetts’s Springfield Union and The Washington Post, he wound up, inevitably, in New York, where he began writing for the New York Herald Tribune.The break Wolfe got that year is the stuff of legend among long-form journalists. After a newspaper strike broke out, Wolfe, looking for a freelance assignment, successfully pitched Esquire on a story about the world of hot rods—out in Los Angeles, a teen subculture had emerged around customizing cars for speed and style. But after several weeks reporting the story out in California, he returned wholly overwhelmed by his own material. He wrote nothing. Esquire’s presses, meanwhile, had already printed large color photographs to accompany Wolfe’s story. It had to run. Esquire editor Byron Dobell finally told Wolfe to send along his notes in the hopes that another writer could turn them into a workable article. And in a marathon writing session, Wolfe shaped all he’d collected into a rambling and digressive but detailed 50-page letter. Dobell read it, struck out the greeting and signature, and  it as it was. The title: “There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy Kolored (Thphhhhhh!) Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby (Rahghhhh!) Around the Bend (Brummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm) …” Instantaneously—almost literally overnight—Wolfe became one of the most famous magazine writers in America. The stylistic flourishes and rule-breaking informalities that Esquire’s readers went mad for would only get wilder and more daring in Wolfe’s subsequent writing. Run-on sentences; onomatopoeia; wholly invented punctuation; a torrent of cultural and historical references both high and low; streams of consciousness; shifting perspectives; kaleidoscopic imagery; fashions, furnishings, and other lifestyle markers described in fine and obsessive detail; a tone fluctuating, sometimes within the space of a paragraph, between coolly bemused incredulity and genuinely manic enthusiasm—whether one liked it or not, and many did not, Wolfe was a true original, imbuing features such as his profile of Junior Johnson with something like the spirit of literature.God! The Alcohol Tax agents used to burn over Junior Johnson. Practically every good old boy in town in Wilkesboro, the county seat, got to know the agents by sight in a very short time. They would rag them practically to their faces on the subject of Junior Johnson, so that it got to be an obsession. Finally, one night they had Junior trapped on the road up toward the bridge around Millersville, there’s no way out of there, they had the barricades up and they could hear this souped-up car roaring around the bend, and here it comes—but suddenly they can hear a siren and see a red light flashing in the grille, so they think it’s another agent, and boy, they run out like ants and pull those barrels and boards and sawhorses out of the way, and then— Ggghhzzzzzzzhhhhhhggggggzzzzzzzeeeeeong! —gawdam! there he goes again, it was him, Junior Johnson! with a gawdam agent’s si-reen and a red light in his grille!Like Lewis’s 2015  in Vanity Fair, Radical Wolfe suggests Wolfe’s style was substantially derived from the casual letters he would send to his parents. “I ended up doing really what a lot of us do in letters, particularly when you’re writing a letter to somebody you feel very comfortable with, someone you can unburden your soul to,” Wolfe once told an interviewer. “And you don’t censor out all of the random remarks that are running through your head. You don’t censor out the slang, you don’t censor out the exclamations, and you don’t censor out the abrupt changes of thought.”But it hardly seems a coincidence that other journalists started experimenting with the medium at around the same time. Thanks substantially to Wolfe, the term “New Journalism,” a label that had been applied to a variety of new developments in the profession for decades, acquired a specific association with the work of writers like Wolfe himself, his friends and rivals Gay Talese and Hunter S. Thompson, and peers like Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, Truman Capote, and George Plimpton—all of whom, in their own ways, were  the prevailing strictures and conventions of nonfiction.Radical Wolfe explains their rise, rather simply, as a product of the era’s sociopolitical and cultural upheavals. “Journalists are rebelling against what everyone else was rebelling against,” Esquire Classic’s Alex Belth explains as a picture of Joan Didion comes up on the screen. “Wolfe and that generation, they’re trying to capture a world that seems to be going faster and faster.” “They were all trying to create an excitement on the page,” Lewis says in another snippet, “and all the things that are changing in America, it’s reflected in kind of the way the prose looks and sounds.”But there were large and meaningful differences between the approaches and styles the leading lights of New Journalism adopted. While some wrote prose that almost matched the giddy excitement and overstimulation of Wolfe’s, others, Didion chief among them, maintained a placid reserve. Didion’s work also happens to challenge the idea, moreover, that New Journalism was intrinsically a literature of rebellion, motivated or inspired by the major social movements and cultural upheavals of the era. She wrote with a palpable disdain for the American counterculture and even the women’s movement; Slouching Towards Bethlehem, in particular, is a high-resolution  of a country beginning to spiral, by her lights, out of control.As a film about one writer in particular, Radical Wolfe can probably be forgiven for not delving too deeply or convincingly into why New Journalism emerged as a broader phenomenon. It is less forgivable, however, that the documentary sketches Wolfe himself so thinly and offers up little that those familiar with his work wouldn’t already know—he was an arch satirist and an innovative prose stylist, viewers are told, with a fondness for white suits, which the film inevitably lingers on. “I think if you started to get a little famous as a writer in the late 60s, early 70s in the United States, you had some obligation to be a character,” Lewis says. “You could be outrageous like Hunter Thompson, you could be a pseudo- Englishman like William F. Buckley, you could stab your wife like Norman Mailer, and the white suit enabled people to think of him as this great, unusual character.”Wolfe had an untroubled personal life—one wife of 40 years and two children—and a quiet, reserved personality at odds with his showy and often ribald prose. The suit compensated for that—the lone memorable component, beyond Wolfe’s writing itself, of what Gay Talese, at one point in the film, calls “the facade of being Tom Wolfe.” And it was enough for a time: The 1987 publication of the zeitgeist-capturing New York City novel The Bonfire of the Vanities delivered Wolfe and his white suit into literary stardom with all the fixings—commencement addresses,  on The Simpsons, invitations to panels and festivals and late-night shows where he waxed lyrical about the trends and tumults shaping American culture at the end of the twentieth century and The End of History.But eventually, it all started wearing thin. A Man in Full (1998), his widely anticipated second novel, sold a lot and was forgotten almost immediately. Radical Wolfe passes over his other novels—2004’s I Am Charlotte Simmons and 2012’s Back to Blood—in an embarrassed near-silence. After a perfunctory glance at Wolfe’s widely panned last book, 2016’s The Kingdom of Speech, which  a takedown of nothing less than Darwin’s theory of evolution, the film is substantively done, leaving unanswered the question Lewis opens it with—the question he first asked himself at 12 or 13 upon reading Wolfe’s  of Leonard Bernstein’s fundraiser for the Black Panthers, “Radical Chic.” “Even though Tom wasn’t really talking about himself very much, there was this—boom—this personality coming off the page,” he recalls. “And I remember wondering, ‘Who wrote this? Who’s Tom Wolfe?’”That’s a question best answered by attending more closely to the substance of Wolfe’s writing than Radical Wolfe does.Though he’ll be remembered as an inventive journalist who managed a moderately successful turn to popular fiction, Tom Wolfe was also a social theorist in natty but thin disguise—his work both espoused a mostly coherent worldview and made a case for a particular way of viewing the world. All told, the bulk of Wolfe’s writing is animated by a conviction that revolutions of style are also revolutions of substance—look closely enough at an aesthetic trend or fashionable consumer fad, he insists excitedly, time and time again, and you’ll find the elements of a social or cultural turn, and perhaps one that’s escaped the attentions of most cultural observers.His Esquire  on hot rods, for instance, the piece that brought him to prominence, is more than just the first major showcase for his pyrotechnic prose or an informative and engaging look at youth car culture. It’s an exhortation, one that he’d repeat often, to locate meaning in the putatively superficial—to examine the values underpinning artifice. “I don’t have to dwell on the point that cars mean more to these kids than architecture did in Europe’s great formal century, say, 1750 to 1850,” he wrote. “They are freedom, style, sex, power, motion, color—everything is right there. Things have been going on in the development of the kids’ formal attitude toward cars since 1945, things of great sophistication that adults have not been even remotely aware of, mainly because the kids are so inarticulate about it, especially the ones most hipped on the subject.”Being articulate about the inarticulable, for Wolfe, demanded the adoption of a now standard critical posture—taking popular culture seriously and viewing its products and developments as worthy of close study, if not respect. Through this lens and in his hands, a  like Phil Spector, for instance, the twentysomething tycoon savant of early ’60s pop, might additionally be understood as a cultural figure of almost world-historical importance. “Every baroque period has a flowering genius who rises up as the most glorious expression of its style of life,” he wrote in a 1965 profile. “In latter-day Rome, the Emperor Commodus; in Renaissance Italy, Benvenuto Cellini; in late Augustan England, the Earl of Chesterfield; in the sal volatile Victorian age, Dante Gabriel Rossetti; in late-fancy neo-Greek Federal America, Thomas Jefferson; and in Teen America Phil Spector is the bona-fide Genius of Teen.”Wolfe’s very writing style, and the New Journalism more broadly, reflected this disposition and advanced a then-controversial argument: that journalism—lowly, quotidian writing for the masses, long passed over and sniffed at by the literary world—could be a kind of popular art. And almost immediately after he began drawing major attention, well-regarded authors and critics clambered out of the woodwork to loudly disagree: “the sudden arrival of this new style of journalism, from out of nowhere,” Wolfe  proudly in the introduction to his 1973 anthology, The New Journalism, “had caused a status panic in the literary community.”[A]ll of a sudden, in the mid-Sixties, here comes a bunch of these lumpenproles, no less, a bunch of slick-magazine and Sunday-supplement writers with no literary credentials whatsoever in most cases—only they’re using all the techniques of the novelists, even the most sophisticated ones—and on top of that they’re helping themselves to the insights of the men of letters while they’re at it—and at the same time they’re still doing their low-life legwork, their ‘digging,’ their hustling, their damnable Locker Room Genre reporting—they’re taking on all of these roles at the same time—in other words, they’re ignoring literary class lines that have been almost a century in the making.Wolfe would spend much of his career identifying and chronicling similar upheavals: the first astronauts, instant celebrities, leapfrogging fighter pilots in the status and honor hierarchy detailed in The Right Stuff; Junior Johnson and stock car racers cruising past a disapproving Southern gentry in public estimation in “The Last American Hero”; pop culture– and Pop Art–adjacent It Girls  Baby Jane Holzer toppling New York’s high society debutantes, as recounted in 1964’s “The Girl of the Year.” “Once it was power that created high style,” he wrote. “But now high styles come from low places, from people who have no power, who slink away from it, in fact, who are marginal, who carve out worlds for themselves in the nether depths, in tainted ‘undergrounds.’”The central tenet of his social thought was that the postwar boom had delivered the United States more prosperity than it knew what to do with.Gradually, over the course of his career, Wolfe cobbled all this material into a kind of grand theory of American life, one that earns him a place, alongside figures like Thorstein Veblen and Erving Goffman, as one of the most important writers on status and prestige in our society. The central tenet of his social thought was that America’s post–World War II economic boom had delivered the country more prosperity than it knew what to do with. “It has pumped money into every class level of the population on a scale without parallel in any country in history,” he  in “The ‘Me’ Decade,” his essay on the 1970s. “In America truck drivers, mechanics, factory workers, policemen, firemen, and garbagemen make so much money—$15,000 to $20,000 (or more) per year is not uncommon—that the word proletarian can no longer be used in this country with a straight face.”Fatally for the political left, from Wolfe’s perspective, that freedom and plenty for the average American had been produced by capitalism—without a revolution or the social and economic engineering of dour utopian planners. “The new freedom was supposed to be possible only under socialism,” he wrote. It wasn’t supposed to result from “a Go-Getter Bourgeois business boom such as began in the U.S. in the 1940’s.” And “the liberated man” it produced, he pointed out, “didn’t look right.” In personal dress, modesty and humility had been expected; instead, prosperity had decked the American worker out in gaudy fashions. (“$35 Superstar Qiana sport shirts with elephant collars and 1940s Airbrush Wallpaper Flowers Buncha Grapes and Seashell designs all over them.”)The average American similarly rejected the austere trends in modernist architecture that Wolfe described and derided in 1981’s . While the minimalist innovations of figures like Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe and the European left’s aspirations for “worker housing” would influence American public housing projects for the poor and, rather ironically, corporate office buildings, the expanding middle class wound up flowing out of the country’s urban centers and tall apartment buildings altogether. They favored “houses with pitched roofs and shingles and clapboard siding,” “the more cute and antiquey touches, the better,” Wolfe observed. They outfitted their suburban homes “with ‘drapes’ such as baffled all description and wall-to-wall carpet you could lose a shoe in, and they put barbecue pits and fish ponds with concrete cherubs urinating into them on the lawn out back, and they parked the Buick Electras out front and had Evinrude cruisers up on tow trailers in the carport just beyond the breezeway.”Developments like these left America’s social critics in a pickle. Wolfe argued that American thinkers—eager to maintain their relevance and match the seriousness and gravity of European intellectuals who had their countries helpfully ravaged, with some regularity, by violent conflict—actively ignored the country’s rising prosperity in favor of issuing ponderous and overly pessimistic declamations against wealth inequality, structural racism, government abuses, and other social ills. The disorders of the late 1960s, he contended, had been actively welcomed and relished. “There were riots on the campuses and in the slums,” he wrote. “The war in Vietnam had developed into a full-sized hell. War! Revolution! Imperialism! Poverty! I can still remember the ghastly delight with which literary people in New York embraced the Four Horsemen. The dark night was about to descend.”Instead, for most Americans, the angst of the late ’60s eventually gave way, despite the best efforts of the country’s leading buzzkills. In one 1976 essay, Wolfe  following another writer’s disquisition on the state of American society with an impolitic remark during a campus speaking appearance. “Suddenly I heard myself blurting out over my microphone: ‘My God, what are you talking about? We’re in the middle of a … Happiness Explosion!’”The “Happiness Explosion” scattered new lifestyles and subcultures for Wolfe to cover across the country in all directions—the surfers of Southern California; Hugh Hefner and the swinging playboys who emulated him; stock car racers, hot-rodders, and demolition derby drivers enthralled by that shining emblem of American postwar plenty, the automobile. These new “statuspheres,” as Wolfe called them, allowed Americans to overcome or subvert old social hierarchies—they came with their own rules and allowed those within them to succeed, culturally, on their own terms.No statusphere or subculture fascinated Wolfe more than the world of the hippies, the subject of his 1968 classic, . The literary dropout Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters were, to Wolfe, more than just a roving troupe of LSD-addled hedonists. They were an ecstatic, distinctively modern, and distinctively American religious cult, made possible by capitalism’s bounty and the scientific and technological advances underpinning the production of LSD and psychedelic art—a “true mystic brotherhood” that had taken root “in poor old Formica polyethylene 1960s America without a grain of desert sand or a shred of palm leaf or a morsel of manna wilderness breadfruit overhead, picking up vibrations from Ampex tapes.”While Kesey and his followers saw themselves as outcasts from mainstream society and crisscrossed the country in a bus trying to trip-out and turn-on the squares, Wolfe framed the hallucinatory highs they experienced on acid as mere extensions of an already phantasmagoric American reality— outgrowths of the surreal freedoms and pleasures available to ordinary Americans in the suburbs Kesey himself had come from. (The “world of Mom&Dad&Buddy &Sis in the suburbs” was already full of futuristic luxuries, like the family car in the driveway—a “crazy god-awful-powerful fantasy creature” with “327 horsepower.”)But Wolfe’s genuine fascination with the hippies was mixed with a sniggering incredulity and even disgust at their antics. Like Didion, Wolfe came away from San Francisco in the late 1960s convinced that the center wasn’t holding in Haight- Ashbury or America at large. While Acid Test is often framed and remembered—even in Radical Wolfe—as a celebration of the counterculture, Wolfe’s actual disposition toward the hippies is laid bare in passages like his account of the fate of “Stark Naked,” a Prankster who’d taken to wearing nothing or next to it and had seemingly melted her brain into a warm paste on LSD. At one of the stops on the tour, she mistakes a stranger’s young son for her “own divorced-off little boy” and runs naked and shrieking toward him. Stark Naked, Wolfe concludes, “had completed her trip. She had gone with the flow. She had gone stark raving mad.”While the postwar boom had materially improved the lives of most Americans, Wolfe also believed that the freedom and prosperity they enjoyed had bred cultural confusion—as exemplified by the hippies. “THE ‘ME’ DECADE AND THE THIRD GREAT AWAKENING,” for instance, is a breezily written but substantively grave assessment of the excesses and narcissistic indulgences Wolfe believed were corroding American life—easy sex, consumerism, and the phony, self-centered spiritualism driving a “Third Great Awakening.” “All rules are broken!” he wrote. “The prophets are out of business! Where the Third Great Awakening will lead—who can presume to say? One only knows that the great religious waves have a momentum all their own. Neither arguments nor policies nor acts of the legislature have been any match for them in the past. And this one has the mightiest, holiest roll of all, the beat that goes … Me … Me … Me … Me …”Wolfe ends the piece with a then- uncharacteristically serious and direct push for his readers to reject “the luxury, enjoyed by so many millions of middling folk, of dwelling upon the self” and embrace the elemental realities their forebears had. Soldiers laying their lives on the line for their country and parents willing to sacrifice “their own ambitions and their material assets” were, for Wolfe, role models the country should return to, people who understood their lives “however unconsciously, as part of a great biological stream.” (1979), Wolfe’s book on the first American astronauts, the Mercury Seven, can be read as an exploration of the virtues Wolfe wanted more Americans to adopt. The right stuff that John Glenn and Alan Shepard exemplified was something more than mere bravery or moxie. It was the capacity to genuinely improve oneself—not through narcissistic introspection or consumption, but by taking on “a seemingly infinite series of tests.” And what the Mercury Seven demonstrated, he suggested, was that the task of self-improvement might ideally be undertaken “in a cause that means something to thousands, to a people, a nation, to humanity, to God.”It should perhaps go without saying at this point that Wolfe was a conservative. This is obvious enough in his writing that Radical Wolfe’s reticence about his politics is striking and curious. “He sat at a very uncomfortable intersection between red America, blue America, left and right,” Lewis says unhelpfully at one point. “He avoided being too closely identified with any kind of political ideology.” This was true of many of Wolfe’s interviews and public statements, but his writing simply wasn’t as open to ideological interpretation as the film suggests. Its very first overt statement on Wolfe’s political thought comes from The Wall Street Journal’s Gregory Zuckerman, who argues, “in some ways, he’s very much progressive, in that he’s very focused on those overlooked in society.”At a stretch, this might describe Wolfe’s interest in midcentury subcultures, yes. But he’s known just as well for the obsessive, critical attention he paid to the affluent and cultural elites—the contemporary art world and its clueless patrons, the yuppies of ’80s Manhattan, the  of The New Yorker, who drew a telephone call from the White House in their defense after Wolfe skewered the magazine in a still-hilarious pair of 1965 essays.Most of those elites nevertheless fêted and celebrated him for most of his career. If Wolfe minded playing the role of an uncommonly skilled, white-costumed jester in their court, he never showed it; in turn, his well-to-do subjects rarely took the substance of what he said too personally or too seriously. “The strange thing in his life is that while every now and then someone would challenge him in a review on political grounds, most of the New York literary establishment just loved him,” Lewis says. “They loved him personally, they loved what he wrote. And they kind of thought of whatever his political views were as beside the point. And I kind of think they were.”But the notion that Wolfe’s politics were inscrutable and irrelevant is undermined substantially by the presence of one of Radical Wolfe’s most prominent talking heads. Late in the film, Peter Thiel—the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, Republican megadonor, and part-time  in the culture wars—appears like a jump scare to deliver some of its most vapid lines. “It’s almost impossible for someone to do what Tom Wolfe did in our society today,” he says at one point. “It’s been impossible I would say for probably close to 40 years.” Of course, one counterexample to the idea that it’s been impossible to do what Tom Wolfe did for the last 40 years was the career, over the last 40 or so years, of one “Tom Wolfe.” And if taking a scalpel to elites the way that Wolfe did has gotten harder, that surely has at least a little to do with the dispositions of affluent men like Thiel, who bankrolled the lawsuit that shuttered Gawker, one of the last refuges in the press of Wolfe’s puckish, impudent spirit.But on the matter of ideology, and as Thiel clearly perceives, Wolfe and Thiel were simpatico. That’s made especially plain by Wolfe’s Yale dissertation, which is, again, only briefly mentioned in Radical Wolfe. At over 300 pages, “The League of American Writers: Communist Organizational Activity Among American Writers, 1929–1942” should, by all rights, be considered one of Wolfe’s . And as he bitterly complained at the time, he was forced to substantially revise an initial draft of it. “These stupid fucks have turned down namely my dissertation,” he  in a letter, excerpted in Lewis’s Vanity Fair profile. “They called my brilliant manuscript ‘journalistic’ and ‘reactionary,’ which means I must go through with a blue pencil and strike out all the laughs and anti-Red passages and slip in a little liberal merde, so to speak, just to sweeten it.”The surviving final dissertation contains many of the ideas he would return to again and again during his career. It was status competition and anxiety in New York’s literary set during the 1930s, Wolfe argued, that allowed so many writers to become unwitting dupes of the Communist Party—laying the groundwork, he alleged, “for a monolithic, Communist-controlled writer- bureaucracy covering the entire American writing craft” that, fortunately, never came to pass. Some of the tactics the Communist Party used to bring writers into its fold were as simple as providing venues where writers could interact socially—including fundraisers for generically progressive, and not overtly communist-aligned causes. “The Communist organizers in charge were always careful to see to it that the liquor was, indeed, ample.” Once the guests were “steeped in alcoholic spirits and entertainment,” they would lose the ability to distinguish between “the conventional cocktail party symbols of literary status” and “the political symbols and ideology embodied in the cause.” In no time, they’d be making donations.Wolfe reviled Marxism and the radical left for the entirety of his life. Repeatedly in his writings, he makes reference to the work and claims of the Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who, he wrote in a 1976 essay, had demonstrated that “tens of millions” had been killed in Russian gulags, making it “impossible any longer to distinguish the Communist liquidation apparatus from the Nazi.” (It’s thought today that  two million died in the gulags.) And it’s hard to imagine the parties writers of the old left threw weren’t on his mind as he penned his most notorious nonfiction piece, his account of Leonard Bernstein’s fundraiser for the Black Panthers, “Radical Chic.”In January 1970, Bernstein  a party at his Park Avenue penthouse apartment to raise funds for the legal defense of 21 members of the Black Panther Party, who were accused and later fully acquitted of a bomb plot. The assembled luminaries, including Barbara Walters, the director Otto Preminger, the photographer Richard Avedon, and New York Review of Books editor Robert Silvers, rubbed shoulders, eating “Roquefort morsels” as they discussed social justice. Wolfe’s report on the proceedings is, even today, a devastating read, chock-full of the kind of glittering ironies and hypocrisies he collected like a magpie. In one scene that  Jordan Peele’s Get Out to mind, Bernstein, patronizing throughout, tries to empathize with Panther Don Cox, who Bernstein thinks is put off by his wealth. “When you walk into this house, you must feel infuriated!” Bernstein tells him. “Don’t you get bitter? Doesn’t that make you mad?” Cox insists he’s fine, but Bernstein presses on: “Having this apartment makes this meeting possible, and if this apartment didn’t exist, you wouldn’t have it. And yet—well, it’s a very paradoxical situation.”The situation might have been even more nakedly paradoxical at the other radical fundraisers then sweeping New York high society if cautious hosts hadn’t, as Wolfe relates, gone out of their way to replace their Black servants so as not to offend the Black Panthers and other minority guests. “Obviously you can’t have a Negro butler and maid, Claude and Maude, in uniform, circulating through the living room, the library and the main hall serving drinks and canapés,” he writes. “So the current wave of Radical Chic has touched off the most desperate search for white servants.” Going without servants altogether, Wolfe emphasizes, was out of the question. (“Why, my God! servants are not a mere convenience, they’re an absolute psychological necessity.”)Wolfe wasn’t skewering wealthy liberals from a position of ideological impartiality, as much as he suggested otherwise in interviews. He considered the left naïve, if not dangerous, on economics, and seemed willfully blind to the gradual erosion of the middle-class stability and prosperity he’d documented. He was troubled less by the political economy of rising inequality than by the extent to which it corroded traditional values and enabled social progressivism. His disdain for the sexual revolution didn’t prevent him from crudely ogling at and objectifying women—and even girls, like the “beautiful little high-school buds in their buttocks-décolletage stretch pants” he  in an essay on Las Vegas. His references to homosexuality don’t read much better: One particularly bizarre late- career short story, “Ambush at Fort Bragg,” frames three soldiers who had murdered a gay serviceman as victims of liberal- media condescension. And pieces like “Radical Chic” in particular surfaced another undercurrent of his work that would only become more central and prominent as his career wore on.Reading a Wolfe piece for outright racism is a bit like watching a cocky acrobat on a tightrope. He struts and sways dangerously; now and again he does, in fact, fall off. Radical Wolfe treads cautiously around the subject, as does Lewis’s Vanity Fair , though Lewis can’t help but mention, in the latter, that one of Wolfe’s letters to his parents from his time working in Washington, D.C., describes one street lined with African embassies as “Cannibals Row.” Most of his writing isn’t quite that crude. But what might charitably be called a pessimism about the possibility of racial harmony is present throughout his work.In 1970, “Radical Chic” was paired off and published as a  with another Wolfe essay called “Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,” an account of confrontations between poor minorities and the hapless bureaucrats, or “flak catchers,” managing social programs at the Office of Economic Opportunity in San Francisco. As Wolfe understood it, the planners behind the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, part of the Johnson administration’s “War on Poverty,” had intentionally encouraged militant organization in community groups as a means of distributing jobs and economic aid. “Instead of handing out alms, which never seemed to change anything, they would encourage the people in the ghettos to organize,” he wrote. “They would help them become powerful enough to force the Establishment to give them what they needed. From the beginning the poverty program was aimed at helping ghetto people rise up against their oppressors. It was a scene in which the federal government came into the ghetto and said, ‘Here is some money and some field advisors. Now you organize your own pressure groups.’”But in practice, Wolfe claimed, the community initiatives that came out of the Economic Opportunity Act did little more than encourage radical groups and street gangs to come together and intimidate or “mau-mau” bureaucrats with the threat of violence—“mau-mau” being a reference to the indigenous rebels who battled the British in Kenya during the 1950s. “If you could make the flak catchers lose control of the muscles around their mouths, if you could bring fear into their faces, your application was approved,” he claimed. “Ninety-nine percent of the time whites were in no physical danger whatsoever during mau-mauing. The brothers understood through and through that it was a tactic, a procedure, a game. If you actually hurt or endangered somebody at one of these sessions, you were only cutting yourself off from whatever was being handed out, the jobs, the money, influence. The idea was to terrify but don’t touch.”It should go without saying that efforts at physical intimidation were not, actually, representative of the community organizing that grew out of the Economic Opportunity Act. But Wolfe was no policy analyst—he was captivated, instead, by the drama of the isolated scenes he witnessed, recording certain details that revealed more about himself than they did about the people he described, like San Francisco’s Samoan immigrant community. “The average Samoan makes Bubba Smith of the Colts look like a shrimp,” he wrote. “They start out at about 300 pounds and from there they just get wider. They are big huge giants. Everything about them is wide and smooth. They have big wide faces and smooth features. They’re a dark brown, with a smooth cast.” All of this, naturally, factored into Wolfe’s broader breakdown of the races that white bureaucrats feared the most. “Whites didn’t have too much fear of the Mexican-American, the Chicano,” he wrote. “The notion was that he was small, placid, slow, no particular physical threat—until he grew his hair Afro-style, talked like a blood or otherwise managed to seem ‘black’ enough to raise hell. Then it was a different story. The whites’ physical fear of the Chinese was nearly zero.”This is the very same superficial lens through which Wolfe would view racial divisions in his fiction. The prologue of The Bonfire of the Vanities finds the mayor of New York despairing about the city’s changing demographic makeup and the determination of affluent whites to ignore it in a stream of consciousness as he’s heckled offstage before an audience in Harlem.Come down from your swell co-ops, you general partners and merger lawyers!

The Bronx—the Bronx is finished for you!In a 1989 essay, Wolfe  that “within ten years political power in most major American cities will have passed to the nonwhite majorities,” a state of affairs that would make it harder for the writer to discern “what truly presses upon the heart of the individual, white or nonwhite, living in the metropolis in the last decade of the twentieth century.’”Wolfe would pursue that theme in three out of his four novels, each of which finds central characters thrust into racialized moral dilemmas complicated by their own status anxiety, the forces of urban politics, and the primordial racial prejudices that, for Wolfe, fundamentally structure urban life. In The Bonfire of the Vanities, Sherman McCoy, a wealthy white bond trader, descends into a legal nightmare and social crisis stoked by a media-savvy Black minister after he and his mistress hit and gravely injure a Black youth they believe might rob them during a detour into “the jungle” of the Bronx; Wolfe’s New York is a powder keg ready to explode. So is his Atlanta. In A Man in Full, Charlie Croker, a boorish and deeply indebted white real estate developer on his second marriage and the cusp of bankruptcy—a country-fried Donald Trump, essentially—is offered a way out of his financial woes if he speaks out in the defense of a Black football star accused of raping the white daughter of another prominent businessman.In Wolfe’s last novel, , Nestor Camacho, a Cuban American cop, deals with the fallout from his community after he both rescues and arrests a Cuban asylum-seeker at sea, preventing him from becoming an American citizen. But Wolfe’s Miami is also, of course, a powder keg ready to explode, particularly after—in passages that are both prescient and more unsettling now than they would have been in 2012—Camacho puts an unarmed Black man in a choke hold, a confrontation captured on video and posted to YouTube. Camacho is “mesmerized” by watching the scene play back on his laptop: “the brute’s face is twisted beyond recognition—from the pain! His mouth is open. He wants to scream. But he wants oxygen more.… Sounds like a dying duck. Yeah!” In the moment he feels “an adrenal rush immensely more powerful than all chains of polite conversation,” a “vile revulsion comes surging up his brain stem from the deepest, darkest, most twisted bowels of hatred.”A collapse of faith and an absent sense of purpose, one character suggests in the novel’s prologue, has encouraged minorities to fall “back to blood” and their ethnic ties: “Religion is dying … but everybody still has to believe in something,” they muse. “So, my people, that leaves only our blood, the bloodlines that course through our very bodies to unite us.” Nowhere in the hundreds of pages Wolfe devotes to the subject across his work does he suggest that there might be a collective way out of this. Instead, Wolfe literally sketches out, in a cartoon featured in a 1980s collection of short writing and caricatures, a picture of perpetual tension and separation. “The Melting Pot” depicts a white man and a Black man—the latter thick-lipped and Afro-headed—on leashes. They are nude and baring their teeth—dogs, snarling viciously, raring to rip each other apart.Radical Wolfe implies strongly that Wolfe and his writing have been victims of changing mores, but Wolfe fell off in estimation and prominence late in his life less because the literary world was offended by him than because it had grown bored with him, and with good reason. In 2000, Wolfe attempted to capture the spirit of the new millennium in his nonfiction anthology, . “American superiority in all matters of science, economics, industry, politics, business, medicine, engineering, social life, social justice, and, of course, the military was total and indisputable,” he wrote, speculating, despite the depth of our racial and cultural divisions, that the close of the “First American Century” might have been just the first chapter in “a Pax Americana lasting a thousand years.” While one can’t exactly blame Wolfe for not anticipating 9/11 and all that would follow it, spending the early 2000s at work on I Am Charlotte Simmons, a turgid and sensationalistic novel about sex on campus, was an odd choice and not one that helped endear him to posterity. By the time Back to Blood rolled around eight years later, Wolfe had essentially vanished from the cultural conversation, save the odd bit of praise for George W. Bush.He did, of course, live long enough to see the central, real-world character of Bonfire’s New York ascend to the presidency—and to receive undoubtedly constant requests for comment on that fact. But Wolfe had remarkably little to say about Trump’s rise. “I’m struck by the weakening of decision-making in America,” he  a French interviewer in 2017. “This collapse is happening at a time when human and financial losses are mounting— war, economic crisis—but above all it’s an issue of identity and ethics. Should we be outraged, or should we observe? I prefer the second option by far. A writer isn’t there to say what’s good or bad. He’s there to say what is.”By this rather inane standard, Wolfe wasn’t especially good at writing. Though his ideological commitments were often not explicit early on, his renderings of “what was” were riven with aesthetic, moral, cultural, and political judgments, often condensed within the space of a single observation.Had he found it in him to say more about Trump, he might have observed that his presidency represented the apex of the social-climbing hedonism he spent most of his life documenting; the status and racial anxieties that were his constant subjects found their ultimate expression in the political rise of a man whose politics are exactly as outrageous, dumb, and showy as his sense of decor. A more thoroughgoing Wolfe would have delighted in showing us why the golden bathroom fixtures mattered; he might have insisted rightly that we ought to take a magnifying glass to the sunbaked minor millionaires and television-addled retirees who make up the clientele at Mar-a-Lago and Trump’s golf courses. One simply cannot understand what has happened to the Republican Party and our politics overall these last 10 years without taking a Wolfian glance at the aesthetics and material aspirations of the right that Wolfe himself, being a conservative, was reluctant to take.Still, Wolfe’s work has much of interest to say to us now. He held a conviction, particularly in his early career, that the good and bad in American life were better shown, in wild and splendid color, than argued or told. This conviction produced journalism of real and enduring value. While his fiction and later nonfiction were heavy with flat, broad stereotypes, Wolfe was capable of being nuanced and incisive on matters of identity. “The wealthy,” “the youth,” “men,” “women,” and “people of color” were, for Wolfe at his best, not cohesive blocs to freely generalize about, as we’re given to today, but messy amalgamations—collections of sub- groups and subcultures worthy of our curiosity and close attention.His obsession with aesthetic details not only enlivened his narratives but also imbued them with much of their very substance. Assessments of style and lifestyles, he suggests, can aid us in mapping the differences within and between America’s peoples with precision. While thinking abstractly about, say, the one percent as a category is useful, one leaves Wolfe with a perhaps exploitable understanding of the cultural, generational, and professional divides that shape the world of the very wealthy. For we are defined, he reminds us, not only by the raw categories that we belong to but by our tastes and aspirations. His attention to how we dress and the things we buy was animated by the belief that who we are is, in large part, a function of what we do and seek out at our leisure. This is why Wolfe’s work itself remains worth seeking out—the man, in full, wrote with a style, verve, and perspective that, for better or for worse, American journalism will not likely see again.</p>

    <h1>The Dubious, Racially Charged Flood Project Biden Is Resurrecting in Mississippi</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Fri, 05 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The wreckage stretched for miles from where Chuck’s Dairy Bar once stood in Rolling Fork, Mississippi. About five weeks before my visit in May, a tornado had ripped through, killing  people there and in the surrounding area and destroying swaths of this small town. On the restaurant’s plot fluttered an American flag, alongside a sign advertising Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster assistance. Looming nearby was a roughly 11-foot-high statue of a bull with a sign on its side: “NO MORE BULL. FINISH THE PUMPS.” The slogan refers to the Yazoo Pumps, a federal project first authorized by Congress all the way back in 1941 to pump floodwater out of this sparsely populated part of the Mississippi Delta, known as the Yazoo Backwater, which routinely floods low-lying farmland. Less common are devastating floods like the infamous one in  that displaced around 640,000 people across multiple states and prompted the passage of federal laws such as the one authorizing the pumps. Although the Army Corps of Engineers installed vast flood-control infrastructure in the backwater and elsewhere in the Delta, the pumps still haven’t been built. But the Biden administration has resurrected the project: While I was in Mississippi, the Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency  they want to build the pumps, with the Corps promising to deliver an assessment this month. That, in turn, has reignited warring sides in a long-running debate that draws on deeply rooted tensions around race and class in this stretch of the Mississippi Delta. The pumps would drain as much as  a day out of the area, but environmental groups have long opposed the plan because of its  to empty much of the area’s . There are also concerns that the project’s cost—which opponents say could top , and which the Corps declined to estimate in response to my queries—might  to invest in the Delta, one of the . While pump supporters regularly frame their case in terms of economic, environmental, and racial justice, the project would disproportionately benefit white landowners. Since the tornado was not accompanied by flooding, the bull and its message have rankled some in the community. “That tornado hit on March 24, and about 72 hours later that bull was placed right in there in that town in the middle of all that destruction, promoting that phrase, ‘Finish the Pumps,’” said Ty Pinkins, a local attorney who’s  Mississippi’s Republican Senator Roger Wicker for his seat in 2024. Pinkins said the pump supporters used the tornado as “an opportunistic moment” to “place that message in the middle of all that, instead of using that energy to uplift community members.”A white farmer with a 6,500-acre agricultural operation owns the bull. Its placement in the days after the tornado—in a town where  percent of residents are Black—is symbolic of what critics  is the area’s white farming elites’ cynical efforts to advance their own interests by suggesting the pumps will primarily benefit Black residents. The two counties that make up the vast majority of the backwater, Sharkey and Issaquena, are 70 percent Black. Their poverty rates are significantly higher than Mississippi’s average, and more than triple the national average. Last May, the census identified them as two of 341 counties nationwide characterized by “.”“The region’s unique history of slavery,” the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights stated in a , “with its debilitating legacies—the sharecropping system, Jim Crow laws, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a minority white population, the political disenfranchisement of blacks, and the nearly total social segregation of the races—has been well documented and is generally viewed as the most significant factor in the region’s present position as among the poorest, if not the poorest, section of the nation based on virtually every socioeconomic measurement.”Pump proponents tend to focus on contemporary poverty in the Delta and ignore the historical reasons for its persistence. “Talk about an environmental injustice,” Mississippi’s Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith  in a 2022 congressional hearing after the EPA reasserted a 2008  of the pumps: “This is a true minority community who live in true poverty.” These arguments have gained traction within the Biden administration, as the announcement last May attests. But it’s far from clear how much the pumps would actually benefit the area’s Black majority.One Army Corps analysis found that 80 percent of the pumps’ financial benefits would flow to farmers (the prevention of damage to roads and other infrastructure makes up most of the remaining 20 percent). But after decades of , , , and industry  hostile to small farms, many Black Delta farmers have been pushed off their land. At the beginning of the twentieth century, according to historian John C. Willis, two-thirds of farm owners in the Delta were Black; today, 92 percent of  in Sharkey County and 87 percent in Issaquena are white. Black farmers are even being  as farmworkers (and moreover, the EPA  in 2008 that the pumps could worsen job prospects for farmworkers).The case for the pumps was reenergized in 2019 after a devastating flood lasted over six months, putting  of farmland underwater and damaging hundreds of homes and other buildings. Two people  when their car drove off a road into floodwaters. The —a business group advocating for farming interests, of which the owner of the Rolling Fork bull is a board member—and some  of a small, majority-white community  to promote the pumps by  with Mississippi’s senators, launching a , and  at community hearings. They’ve been joined by the Army Corps’s official local government partner, the Mississippi Levee Board, which has long focused on helping the area’s agriculture industry.In a  supporting the pumps, the Levee Board said more than 90 percent of homes lost in the 2019 flood “were owned by our Black and Indigenous people of color (BIPOC) neighbors.” But Mississippi Emergency Management Agency data analyzed by environmental groups, as well as local , appears to contradict that claim. The data  the bulk of housing flood claims came from Warren County, of which only a sliver is inside the Backwater. While Warren County’s white and Black populations are nearly even at around 49 percent, Eagle Lake, the county’s largest community of around 300 people in the Backwater, is over .The Levee Board walked its claim back when I filed an open records request for data or evidence to back it. In a , the board’s attorney described the buildings not as “homes” but as “structures.” Unlike the board’s press release, he described them not as BIPOC-owned or occupied, but rather as located “in minority areas.” He told me the Levee Board based the claim on verbal remarks by an Army Corps official in 2021 who “did not provide written documentation related to this assessment of minority ownership.” The Army Corps did not answer questions.“It really is quite shocking that the Biden Administration would propose this project,” Pinkins, who is Black, wrote in a  to the Corps and EPA, “since its true purpose is to help already rich farm owners get even richer by planting more crops on their large low-lying farms while the needs and requests of Black community members continue to be ignored.” In a follow-up  in August, Pinkins was joined by 49 other community members in opposing the pumps.It’s worth noting that many Black community members do support the pumps, and some—like Tracy Harden, owner of Chuck’s Dairy Bar—make environmental justice arguments for them. But it is far from clear whether the few Black-owned farms left in the area would benefit more from the pumps than from other flood mitigation measures. And backwater towns like Rolling Fork, where most of the area’s Black majority live, generally do not get flooded since they are built on higher ground. “If you want to help folks in that area needing flood protection, you don’t need pumps to do it,” said Leonard Shabman, an economist with the nonprofit Resources for the Future. Shabman, who has served in government roles examining Army Corps projects,  the issue for the EPA two decades ago. For far less money, he said, roads and homes can be elevated and more levees can be built. In fact, the pumps could make things worse for some Black residents. The water pumped out of the Yazoo Backwater will exacerbate flooding downstream in a , majority-Black neighborhood on the north side of Vicksburg. The Corps says the added risk is . However, an expert consultant hired by environmental groups found the Corps’s model of downstream impacts  it “cannot be trusted.”Ideally, the federal government would resolve these debates. The Army Corps is assessing the project, saying it  to conducting “meaningful outreach to communities with environmental justice concerns.” Its findings, which should offer a clearer picture of whom the pumps would benefit, are expected to be unveiled this month. But the EPA  major shortcomings with the Corps’s last two environmental justice assessments,  “insufficient data” to address the project’s benefits and a “lack of an adequate evaluation” of possible harm to downstream communities.The Army Corps’s past attempts at community engagement raise questions about how successful the outreach will be. The Corps did not mention any interviews with community members in its most recent environmental justice  in 2020. A 2007 assessment includes interviews with only 16 people. “Because the Yazoo Backwater Area is largely rural, individual interviews were difficult,” it . Insufficient outreach isn’t the only problem. At an August 2022 listening session in Rolling Fork, the aggressiveness of some pump supporters led to accusations of intimidation. Black and white attendees expressed a range of views, mostly supportive of the pumps. But according to Charles V. Taylor Jr., the executive director of the NAACP Mississippi state conference, “When people spoke against the pumps, the majority-white crowd heckled them.… There was a lot of profanity, anger.”Taylor’s organization does not take a position on the pumps themselves. But he raised his concerns earlier this year with Mississippi’s Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, and it’s clear they’re known to the Army Corps: Mike Connor, an Army assistant secretary, acknowledged as much when I spoke to him. I asked him if he thinks the Corps has had sufficient engagement with members of the Black community. “I will never say we’ve heard enough, and we are keeping the doors open,” he said. But there were only a handful of Black community members in the audiences at two listening sessions I attended in May. Louie Miller of the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society’s Jill Mastrototaro are among the most visible opponents of the Yazoo pumps. Both are white. They also documented problems during the August 2022 Rolling Fork meeting. In a  to the White House’s Council of Environmental Quality, which convened the event, they said one of them was “accosted by a drunk audience member that required the intervention of two law enforcement officers.” They said a police officer took “the initiative to escort us safely out of the building.”A Vicksburg Post  also notes law enforcement escorted Representative Thompson out of the building. Thompson has staked out a careful position on the pumps,  on the government’s decision-making to be driven by science and the law. He has been  online by pump supporters, and Senator Hyde-Smith  in 2021 that “Thompson destroyed this project.”The Rolling Fork meeting was not the first time that pump supporters have lashed out at opponents. Even a local small-business owner well connected in state GOP politics has faced hostility for opposing the pumps. During the 2019 flood, pump supporters  a store owned by William Van Devender, a white member of the fundraising committee of Tate Reeves’s first (and winning) campaign for governor. Van Devender had opposed the pumps in a  to a Corps official, urging economic development of the area instead.Nonetheless, some locals are still speaking out. “For decades, the Yazoo Pumps has been held out as the promised solution to flooding in our counties and the rest of Mississippi’s Yazoo Backwater Area,”  Pinkins and 49 other community members this August, “but we are not fooled.” This story was produced in partnership with the , or POGO.</p>

    <h1>Twitter Is Helping Push the Most Dangerous Epstein Conspiracy Theory Yet</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 22:42:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Twitter’s algorithm is promoting what may be the most unsavory conspiracy theory yet: that the  is somehow part of a larger Jeffrey Epstein cover-up.Since Wednesday evening’s release of 943 pages of court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring, the conspiracy theories . But now, X (formerly known as Twitter) is helping take it to the next level.One post by a verified QAnon promoter became the center of attention, garnering the most views on the floundering social media platform for claiming that the Perry shooting was a “false flag” to “distract the media” from the release of the documents.“Not even 24 hours after the Epstein court document was released we have multiple victims who were shot at Perry High School in Perry, Iowa,” posted user , mere moments after 17-year-old student gunman Dylan Butler opened fire on his classmates, killing at least one person and leaving another five injured. It received more than 1.5 million views by the time of publication.“Make no mistake this is a false flag to distract the media from discussing anything in relation to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients. As more names will be released in the coming days we expect more serious distractions and false flags,” the account added.It was just one of dozens of QAnon accounts sharing the same sentiment.The false flag disinformation narrative about the Perry High School shooting is spreading pretty quickly on Twitter/X, probably because the platform is leaving up all of the initial posts, which are among the first posts you see when you search for info about the shooting. — Caroline Orr Bueno, Ph.D (@RVAwonk) The wide spreading narrative is an entirely fabricated one, likely influenced by the conspiracy theorists’ own social media algorithms, which have been   as   users’  Since Facebook was hounded for its role in promoting false news articles and memes planted by  meant to influence the 2016 presidential election, social media algorithms have been roundly criticized for isolating users in feeds stacked with what they’d algorithmically  rather than . In reality, practically every major news outlet has covered the recently unsealed documents—in just the last 24 hours, Google has recorded more than 3.8 million new items pertaining to the nine-years-in-the-making release, chief among them articles from reputable news outlets around the globe, including The New York Times, Al Jazeera, the BBC, the Associated Press, The Washington Post, and thousands of others.Meanwhile, there were 134 incidents of gunfire on U.S. school grounds in 2023—translating to an attack less than every three days, according to data from , a statistic that unfortunately makes the occurrence of a school shooting more likely than not, Epstein’s revelatory case files be damned.But not everyone, including some candidates for the highest offices in government, appear to have performed even that miniscule amount of research before sharing their own conspiratorial opinions on the matter.“Not even 12 hours after the Epstein documents are released there is a mass shooting at a high school in Perry, Iowa,”  Florida Republican Lavern Spicer, who is running for the state’s 24th Congressional District. “I ain’t saying nothing,” she added.X’s algorithmic choices on Thursday add to growing concern about the direction of the platform under , who has himself shared antisemitic and conspiratorial rhetoric that ultimately drove dozens of the company’s biggest advertisers, including Disney and IBM, off the platform.</p>

    <h1>Oklahoma Tells Low-Income Kids to Go Hungry</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 22:35:33 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Oklahoma, one of the  in the country for child hunger, has  a federal program that would have provided food for low-income children over the summer.The summer EBT benefits program launched nationwide in 2023, after being pilot-tested for a few years. Under the program, eligible families would have received $40 per eligible child, per month, in the form of a pre-loaded card that can be used to buy groceries. The benefits work in conjunction with other food aid programs such as SNAP and WIC.The deadline for states to indicate they intended to opt in to the program was on January 1. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt’s office said they were concerned that states had to opt in before the exact rules of the program had been finalized. Stitt’s office also said that the program could incur new administrative costs. (All of the benefits are funded by the federal program, and states simply have to pay half the cost to run the actual program.)But gubernatorial spokeswoman Abegail Cave argued that the summer EBT program was unnecessary. “Oklahoma already has multiple programs to serve food-insecure children across Oklahoma,” she .Chris Bernard, the president and CEO of Hunger Free Oklahoma, pointed out that about 20 percent of children in Oklahoma currently experience food insecurity, while about 60 percent rely on free or reduced-price school lunches.“We’re one of the worst in the nation, and that’s been true for a while now,” Bernard said. “Parents are going to skip meals, or you’re going to stretch meals farther. The charitable side will try and fill that gap. But there are going to be some struggles.”Although Oklahoma has rejected the summer program, the Cherokee and Chickasaw Nations, both of which are located in the Sooner State, are opting in. The Cherokee Nation joined the program when it was still in its pilot stage, and leaders reported helping feed 7,000 children in the summer of 2023.“I wish Oklahoma was participating. It’s frankly mystifying as to why they’re not participating for a relatively small administrative cost, bringing federal tax dollars back home in the form of a benefit for low-income families. That’s, to me, as much of a no brainer as you could get. I’m baffled as to why the state of Oklahoma is not participating,” said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr.It’s not just Oklahoma: A total of just 39 states, territories, and tribal nations have indicated they plan to join the program this summer,  to the U.S. Food and Nutrition Service.This, unfortunately, follows a larger trend of politicians apparently wanting kids to go hungry. In June, the Republican Study Committee  a proposed budget for 2024. One of the party’s professed priorities is to eliminate the Community Eligibility Provision, or CEP, from the School Lunch Program, because “CEP allows certain schools to provide free school lunches regardless of the individual eligibility of each student.”</p>

    <h1>House Republican Admits He’ll Kill Border Deal If It Helps Biden</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 21:03:36 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Texas Representative Troy Nehls showed his true colors on Wednesday, refusing to back any sort of border deal because he claimed it could help President Joe Biden’s .“Let me tell you, I’m not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden’s approval rating,” the MAGA Republican told .“I will not help the Democrats try to improve this man’s dismal approval ratings. I’m not going to do it. Why would I? Chuck Schumer has had H.R. 2 on his desk since July. And he did nothing with it,” Nehls added., an asylum-limiting immigration bill that passed in the House with zero Democratic votes, has proven to be an unstoppable headache for Congress with an almost zero percent chance of passing in the Democratic-controlled Senate or being signed by the president.That hasn’t stopped House Republicans, more than 60 of whom traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Wednesday, from rejecting any sort of bipartisan deal on border security.And Nehl’s confession on Wednesday may hint at the reason why: Republicans care more about who sits in the White House than doing anything about the border situation they keep harping on about.“When the House clings to H.R. 2 as the only solution … we’re not going to get a deal,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer  on Wednesday. “We’re willing to meet the Republicans a good part of the way. I think now in the last few days, many Republicans have begun to realize that we are willing to do that and how serious we are about getting this done.”The transparently vacuous approach to building a border wall is not an uncommon party trick for conservatives, who have been so inoperative on their self-proclaimed party objectives in recent years that their own caucus has taken to railing against them on the House floor.In November,  laid into his party for failing to pass any laws or reach meaningful policy goals that could translate to campaign talking points, leveraging years of inaction at the border under Trump’s presidency as his primary example.“One thing. I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing. One. That I can go campaign on and say we did,” Roy said. “One!”“With all due respect to former President Trump, they sure as hell didn’t get border security done when we had the White House and the House and the Senate,” Roy said. “Talked a big game about building a wall and having Mexico pay for it. Ain’t no wall, and Mexico didn’t pay for it, and we didn’t pass any border security.”</p>

    <h1>Trump Is Absolutely Losing It Over His E. Jean Carroll Case</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 19:48:52 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Donald Trump has lost another  with E. Jean Carroll, and he’s handling it in a classic fashion: by completely flying off the handle.Over the span of about 30 minutes Thursday morning, Trump made 31 posts about Carroll on Truth Social. Although he didn’t say anything himself, he shared stories from conservative outlets attacking her and comments from internet users calling her “creepy.” He also shared media interview clips and social media posts that appear to come from Carroll, all stripped of context so as to paint her as some sort of sexual deviant.Trump’s gross little rampage is likely the result of a Wednesday court  rejecting his latest attempt to  his upcoming trial for defaming Carroll. The trial is due to start on January 15.In May, a jury unanimously  Trump liable for sexual abuse and battery against Carroll in the mid-1990s and for defaming her in 2022 while denying the assault. He was ordered to pay her  in damages.The upcoming trial is for comments Trump made in 2019, when he said Carroll made up the rape allegation to promote her memoir. Presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that since Trump has already been found liable for , his 2019 comments are by default . Carroll is now seeking up to $12 million in damages.Trump has tried to argue that he has  from the second defamation lawsuit, which Kaplan has repeatedly . A main reason behind Kaplan’s decision is the fact that Trump waited three years before bringing up his immunity defense, and then another seven months before he actually moved to use that defense.Trump appealed Kaplan’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which ruled against him in mid-December. The three-judge panel also determined that Trump had waived his right to claim immunity by waiting for so long to bring up the potential defense.Trump filed a motion for the entire array of the appeals court’s judges to rehear his case. The Second Circuit  his request Wednesday, without explanation, per standard procedure. This is likely what sent Trump over the edge.And now, thanks to his creepy Truth Social posts, Trump may have handed Carroll another chance to take him to court. Allison Gill, a former Veterans Affairs official and host of the podcast Mueller, She Wrote, pointed out that Carroll could ask for an injunction to stop Trump from continuing to make potentially defamatory statements about her.“If an injunction is violated, jail is a remedy, as are additional fines,” Gill  on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

    <h1>New Poll Finds Republicans Seriously Think Trump Is the Greatest Person of Faith</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:45:55 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A new survey suggests that an increasing number of Republicans view Donald Trump as a person of faith, with Trump earning higher ratings than even some of the more vocally religious members of the Grand Old Party, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Mitt Romney.Despite Trump’s sin-filled legal tribulations, 64 percent of Republicans reported that they viewed him as a person of faith, according to a new poll conducted by HarrisX for  in November, up from 53 percent in a similar poll conducted in October.The poll was conducted among 1,012 registered voters between November 21 and 22, 2023, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Trump ranked head and shoulders above his competitors in the upcoming GOP primary. Trump’s primary rival, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who converted from Sikhism to Christianity was viewed as a person of faith by 44 percent of surveyed Republicans, leaving Florida Governor Ron DeSantis once again with the short end of the stick—just 34 percent of Republicans saw the onetime potential Trump usurper as a person of faith.Trump also topped Pence, one of the most vocal Christian evangelists in U.S. politics, by a margin of 8 percent. Even Romney couldn’t compete, with just 34 percent of Republicans viewing him as a person of faith.However, Trump’s ranking as a person of faith differs from how Republicans view his religiosity, and that’s where Pence and Trump trade places. Sixty-two percent of Republicans said they viewed Pence as religious versus 47 percent who said the same for Trump.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden, who attends mass every week, per his White House schedule, was only branded as a person of faith by 13 percent of Republicans—though slightly more, 26 percent, conceded that he was religious.When prompted to explain why they felt Trump was a person of faith, few respondents pointed toward the former president’s actual religious practices. Sixty-seven percent of surveyed respondents replied that it was instead because they viewed him as someone who defends people of faith in the United States. More than half (54 percent) said that they viewed him that way because he “cares about people like me.”People who described Biden as a person of faith, on the other hand, said so in part due to perceptions of his character, describing the president as honest and trustworthy (48 percent), ethical (47 percent), and having a strong moral compass (52 percent).</p>

    <h1>What Biden Needs to Do in the Next 12 Months to Save the Climate</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:39:20 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> New Year’s resolutions may not be worth much, but one hopes the Biden administration has set a few strong ones and intends to stick with them. In the months leading up to the presidential election this November, the White House has a lot of work to do to safeguard climate and environmental policies against the threat of a Republican-controlled White House and Congress. At the top of that to-do list, of course, is being reelected with as much Democratic backing as possible in the House and Senate. As Biden tries to make the case for a second term, though, his administration will also need to finalize rules and regulations that will affect how close the country gets to meeting the climate goals he’s set out. A slate of rules still needs to be put on the books. The Environmental Protection Agency is due to set emissions standards for passenger vehicles and about a quarter of heavy-duty trucks, requiring that manufacturers meet new limits on greenhouse gas and other pollutant emissions across their product lines, starting with 2027 models. The agency projects this could result in as many as 67 percent of new cars being electric by 2032. Also still in the works are regulations on  emissions and —both   by , , and the  they donate to. Other pending items include Securities and Exchange Commission  to require that companies disclose greenhouse gas emissions and the risks climate change poses to their business. The Federal Energy Regulatory Committee is due to set  that could mandate that grid operators, states, and utilities plan to incorporate clean energy. While FERC is an independent agency, Democrats will have to decide whether they want to play hardball in keeping – off of it.Ideally, new rulemaking will happen  before Memorial Day, after which policies could become vulnerable to an infuriating law called the . That Clinton-era statute lets Congress roll back any rules issued during the last 60 days they were in session with a simple majority vote in each chamber and the president’s signature; regulations written at the end of the Biden administration, that is, could be torn up (“disapproved”) if Republicans control the White House and Congress, even by a razor-thin margin. Agencies would be further prohibited from implementing “substantially similar” rules. Congress had only used that authority once prior to 2017, when the Trump administration and GOP House and Senate overturned .While climate advocates would like to see the final versions of proposed standards strengthened from prior drafts and eliminate  for polluters, many also fear that the  just about any new policy faces are making agencies unnecessarily timid. Specifically, the right-wing legal movement has mounted a full frontal assault on the administrative state, undermining agencies’ ability to write their own policies as corporations peddle challenges in lower courts.Policymakers are particularly worried about Supreme Court hearings scheduled for later this month on a pair of cases that could overturn something called the . In essence, SCOTUS’s 1984 ruling in Chevron v. Natural Resources established a precedent that courts defer to the expertise of federal agencies on the question of what constitutes a “reasonable interpretation” of federal statute. Judges, in other words, don’t generally get to decide when agency rules and regulations overstep the mandate Congress has given them in laws passed at any point since 1776. Overturning Chevron offers courts potential veto power over agency rules that do not, in their estimation, hew extraordinarily close to the text of federal law. If the Supreme Court does overturn Chevron, it will be a massive victory for corporations eager to be held accountable to as few laws as possible. Counsel for the plaintiff in one of the cases set up to decide the fate of the Chevron deference——is the New Civil Liberties Alliance, which receives  from foundations, like Donors Trust, with ties to right-wing legal movement architect . These and other legal cases pose real constraints, argues Jeff Hauser, founder and executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a watchdog group that monitors federal agencies. But there’s a delicate balance to be struck between writing smart policies and bad ones. “Regardless of the scope of impact of a proposed regulation, it should be crafted to appear as banal and traditional as possible,” Hauser told me. This would require courts friendly to the idea of dismantling regulations to go after long-standing precedents—a tougher sell for even conservative jurists, albeit not an impossible one. “Make things appear as traditional as possible, and emphasize the most traditional … possible gains.” Still, he argues, the administration has been “much more inclined toward excessive passivity than heedlessly moving forward.”Environmental lawyer and Earthjustice president Abigail Dillen praised the pace at which the Biden administration has been working to roll out new rules, many of which aim to finalize before they become vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act in late spring. Just this last week, the Department of Energy  new efficiency standards for residential freezers and refrigerators. Over the next year, she told me, agencies need “to do what it’s always done: Talk to people impacted and make smart rules. But if the administration is negotiating against itself out of worry about what the courts may do, I think that’s a mistake. The worst thing that this kind of uncertainty could do is create a chilling effect that prevents an ambitious administration from making good on its climate and environmental promises.” Rather than preemptively weakening rules, or failing to get them on the books at all, Dillen said, “The only way to deal with a court that’s aggregating power and making politically unpopular decisions is to make sure that the court takes the blame.”A lot of this may sound unglamorous and technical, but there are also opportunities here to bolster Biden’s reelection chances.  Treasury Department rulemaking over how to implement the administration’s trademark legislative agenda—namely, the Inflation Reduction Act—could raise the profile of these popular policies and catch voters’ attention. They could protect the clean energy incentives Biden championed against Republican attacks over the coming decade too. “It’s going to be another year of getting as much steel in the ground and as much industry commitment as possible so that it becomes politically untenable to pull the rug out from underneath people who are making money and counties that are getting a new tax base,” said Dillen.However much money for clean energy and environmental protection gets out the door in the next 12 months, a second Trump administration will still pose a fearsome threat to any and all progress fighting climate change. , corporate-funded Republican think tanks have already mapped out  to slash and burn the administrative state in the event Republicans take the White House later this year, including in the Heritage Foundation–helmed “Project 2025,” an extensive policy proposal for an incoming Republican president. If it does take power, the GOP can be expected to continue the kind of long-running war of attrition that has hobbled federal agencies’ enforcement abilities across the board, reversing the modest progress the Biden administration has made to rebuild those capacities.Even if strengthened rules are finalized before becoming vulnerable to a Congressional Review Act “disapproval,” a Republican administration would have tremendous sway over their fate. “If you don’t assign anyone to examine gas pipelines then it doesn’t matter what regulations exist to reduce methane emissions from pipelines,” Hauser said. “That’s just a matter of discretion.” The Biden administration needs to do as much as it can to protect climate and environmental regulations in the time it has left. It also really, really needs to win. </p>

    <h1>Arkansas Has a New Abortion Ballot Proposal–and It’s Not as Great as It Seems</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 18:32:11 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A group in Arkansas is working to get abortion protections on the state’s . But experts warn that the measure would actually open the door to more government intervention in reproductive access.The fight for abortion access is increasingly playing out through ballot measures, which have led to  even in otherwise . But should the Arkansas ballot succeed, it would actually provide fewer protections than  did, according to a Wednesday report by .The proposal—which is still awaiting a decision from the state’s attorney general—comes from a ballot committee called Arkansans for Limited Government, or AFLG, which was founded by the democracy nonprofit For AR People. The measure would only codify abortion through 18 weeks of pregnancy, far short of the generally accepted 24-week mark for viability (when a fetus can survive outside the uterus). Roe had allowed abortion up to 24 weeks.Arkansas currently bans all abortion, with only narrow exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person. Democratic attempts to pass laws expanding abortion access have failed. AR People’s executive director, Gennie Diaz, told Slate her group created a ballot measure they believe both sides can ultimately accept as a more moderate approach.Even though the measure clearly allows the state to continue banning abortion, just at a later point, Diaz  the measure is “threading the needle with Arkansas voters on what they view as limited government.”“It’s not meant to be a parlor trick,” she said, arguing that adding some restrictions would appeal to people who consider themselves “pro-life.” “Honestly, it’s not palatable to either end of the spectrum, and that’s intentional.”But if the ballot measure was drafted with anti-abortion voters in mind, it doesn’t seem to have worked. The group Arkansas Right to Life is already  the measure as allowing “abortions up to the moment of birth.” Of course, that’s completely inaccurate on two counts. First, abortions do not occur up to the moment of birth. Second, a pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, whereas the measure bans abortion after only 18. Still, it’s a sign of what anti-abortion Arkansans really think of the measure.AFLG, meanwhile, is not affiliated with Planned Parenthood, nor is it publicly supported by any abortion providers or ob-gyns. Diaz said they consulted reproductive health experts on the ballot measure, but abortion rights experts say the initiative could do more harm than good.Erika Christensen of the group Patient Forward, which supports broad abortion protections,  limiting abortion to a specific point is “willfully ignorant.” She pointed out that a pregnancy can turn fatal for either the fetus or the patient at any point. What’s more, abortion restrictions of any kind stigmatize the procedure and allow the state to monitor and even criminalize pregnancy outcomes. And as with all abortion limitations, the “most under-resourced and over-policed” people, such as women of color, will be hit hardest.There is also rapidly growing evidence that complete abortion access might actually stand a chance on the Arkansas ballot. Since Roe was overturned, multiple Republican-led states have put the question of abortion on the ballot—and every single time, voters choose to . Trying to roll back the 24-week abortion standard could set a dangerous precedent for other red states.Tresa Undem, who co-founded the nonpartisan polling firm PerryUndem, has followed abortion opinions for two decades. She warned that even though AFLG said its ballot measure language had polling support, it’s possible the questions asked didn’t capture the whole picture.What’s more, Undem conducted a  over the summer to see if voters were more likely to support a ballot initiative proposal that mentioned viability versus one that didn’t. She found voters preferred complete, expansive access by 15 points.“I was kind of blown away, frankly,” she  Slate. “That’s a pretty new sentiment.”And that’s why, “in the post-Dobbs world, I just think anyone who’s working on this issue needs to really be careful about assumptions,” Undem said. “People can die.”</p>

    <h1>Trump’s Two-Year Take From Foreign Governments While He Was President Is Staggering</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 17:17:03 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> If you still had any doubts as to whether Donald Trump had self-serving motivations as the nation’s forty-fifth president, then a new report detailing the millions of dollars he received from foreign governments should make it clear it definitely wasn’t America he was putting first.Trump’s businesses received at least $7.8 million from nearly two dozen foreign governments during his presidency, according to documents released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. The pocket-lining funds include money Trump received from some of the “world’s most unsavory regimes,” without ever asking for congressional approval as mandated by the U.S. Constitution.The report, titled “,” notes that it is likely an inconclusive analysis. It details just two years of Trump’s presidency and transactions between just four of his businesses, of which he owns more than 500, with 20 countries.The biggest spenders included China, which gave Trump the largest sum out of all the nations—$5.5 million from entities including China’s Embassy in the United States, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the Hainan Airlines Holding Company—as well as , which gave Trump $615,000. Other nations on the list include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malaysia, Albania, Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, , Kuwait, India, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Thailand, the Self-Declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Mongolia, Lebanon, Latvia, Turkey, Hungary, and Cyprus.$5.6 million from China to Trump.  — southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) “These payments were made while these governments were promoting specific foreign policy goals with the Trump Administration and even, at times, with President Trump himself, and as they were requesting specific actions from the United States to advance their own national policy objectives,” the report notes.“That narrative is insane,” Eric Trump told , adding that “there is no president in United States history who was tougher on China than Donald Trump.” The junior Trump brother also explained to the Times that the Trump Organization did “not have the ability or viability to stop someone from booking through third parties” at the hotel.Republicans have tried to wipe away the report, amplifying their own double standard by claiming that the money stemmed from legitimate business interests, all while pushing an impeachment case against President Joe Biden on the basis of the Biden family’s own business dealings, which even some Republicans have  is a meritless cause.In December,  told reporters that he felt the caucus had failed to provide any evidence pointing to wrongdoing on the sitting president’s part.If only they looked inward.</p>

    <h1>The Far Right Has a Bonkers New Conspiracy Theory on Epstein and Jimmy Kimmel</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 16:26:23 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> People on the far right are aggressively pushing a bonkers new conspiracy theory: that comedian Jimmy Kimmel was on the list of convicted sex offender . And the biggest question seems to be … why?A federal court began releasing documents related to Epstein late Wednesday. The disgraced financier was charged in 2019 with sex trafficking minors, but he killed himself in prison before he could . The more than 900 pages of documents list names of people associated with Epstein and his former partner .Although the documents name a wide range of politicians, academics, and celebrities, Kimmel is not among them. But that hasn’t stopped multiple fake versions of the list that include Kimmel’s name from circulating on X (formerly Twitter).— Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) The conspiracy to include Kimmel  earlier this week when New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. When McAfee’s co-host brought up the Epstein list, Rodgers said, “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, are really hoping that doesn’t come out.”Kimmel threatened to sue Rodgers over the heinous joke,  on X, “For the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein, nor will you find my name on any ‘list’ other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality. Your reckless words put my family in danger. Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court.”Rodgers has not apologized for the comments, which appear to stem from bad blood between the two men. Kimmel made fun of Rodgers’s anti-vax opinions and called him a “tinfoil-hatter” when the quarterback previously brought up the Epstein list in February.When Rodgers mentioned Kimmel on Tuesday, McAfee , “Jimmy mocked him for it, and Aaron has not forgotten about it.”There has been no indication whatsoever that Kimmel would be mentioned on the list. But despite that fact—and the clear animosity behind Rodgers’s terrible quip—conservatives have pushed the Kimmel conspiracy with mind-boggling enthusiasm.If people want to use the Epstein list to back up their  that liberal elites run a global child sex trafficking ring, it’s unclear why they have decided to make Kimmel the poster boy. There are plenty of  that appear on the list (which, to be clear, is not proof of any legal wrongdoing) that would prove their case much better than a mid-tier late-night comedian.</p>

    <h1>Here’s How Trump Is Responding to Being Named in Epstein Documents</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 15:32:05 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The first series of Jeffrey Epstein documents have been released, and as expected they name Donald Trump. And how is the country’s social media–obsessed former president responding? Well he’s gone surprisingly mute.Donald Trump’s last slew of posts on his Twitter-dupe social media platform TruthSocial seemed like an effort to flood his MAGA followers’ timelines with unrelated content. In a series of rapid-fire posts Thursday morning, Trump shared endorsements for his presidential campaign as well as a slew of videos from news outlets validating his legal strategy in his upcoming criminal trials. He also made more than two dozen posts attacking E. Jean Carroll, all within the span of .Despite the flurry of activity, there are absolutely zero mentions of the revelatory unsealing of nearly 900 pages of a lawsuit launched by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre, nearly a decade ago, even though she’s one of Trump’s former employees, meeting Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell roughly two weeks into her employment at Trump’s Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, according to court documents.Along with Trump’s, some of the major names that jump off the pages range from some of the world’s biggest politicos to show-stopping entertainers. They include former President Bill Clinton, British Prince Andrew, Epstein, and Trump legal ally Alan Dershowitz, Michael Jackson, David Copperfield, and Stephen Hawking.Their presence in the documents is not proof of any legal wrongdoing.A Clinton spokesperson has redirected attention to a 2019 statement put out on behalf of the forty-second president denying any knowledge of Epstein’s pedophilic, sex-trafficking empire.“In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,” read the statement.Statement on Jeffrey Epstein. — Angel Ureña (@angelurena) The list of Jane and John Does, which was formed nine years ago, after Giuffre filed a defamation claim against Epstein’s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, was partially released on Wednesday. More of the documents could be unsealed sometime today.Many of the names are expected to be publicly known Epstein associates, including employees of the financier. Other possible names to be unveiled could include Epstein’s clients and perpetrators, though the judge has specified that the identities of minors or sexual assault victims will not be released.</p>

    <h1>Second Biden Official Resigns Over War in Gaza: “I Cannot Be Quietly Complicit”</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:56:16 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A senior Education Department official and the department’s only Palestinian American political appointee has resigned over Joe Biden’s response to the .Tariq Habash, who sent his resignation letter on Wednesday, is at least the second high-ranking Biden administration official to resign in protest over the .“The actions of the Biden-Harris Administration have put millions of innocent lives in danger, most immediately for the 2.3 million Palestinian civilians living in Gaza who remain under continuous assault and ethnic cleansing by the Israeli government. Therefore, I must resign,” Habash said in his .“I mourn each and every loss, Israeli and Palestinian. But I cannot represent an administration that does not value all human life equally.”Nearly all of the  living in the Gaza Strip have been  due to Israel’s unrelenting bombardment of the region. Palestinians were forced to flee to designated “safe zones,” only for Israel to  those areas as well. Almost 22,500 Palestinians have been , the majority women and children. Some organizations, such as the nonprofit Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, put the  at nearly 30,000.South Africa  the International Court of Justice in late December for an urgent order declaring that  is committing genocide against  in its nearly three-month assault on the Gaza Strip. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby  South Africa’s lawsuit on Wednesday as “meritless, counterproductive, and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever.”“I cannot be quietly complicit as this administration fails to leverage its influence as Israel’s strongest ally to halt the abusive and ongoing collective punishment tactics that have cut off Palestinians in Gaza from food, water, electricity, fuel, and medical supplies, leading to widespread disease and starvation,” Habash said in his letter.Over the last three months, our government has aided in the indiscriminate violence against Palestinians in Gaza—over 22,000 civilians killed, thousands more buried under rubble, and the vast majority displaced from their homes. Despite claims that Israel’s focus is on Hamas, its military actions simultaneously persist across the West Bank where there is no Hamas governing presence, with hundreds of Palestinians killed in the West Bank before October and hundreds more killed since. Additionally, thousands of Palestinians have been detained, arrested, and held without charge or trial—a violation of international humanitarian law. Meanwhile, the President has publicly questioned the integrity of Palestinian death counts frequently used by our own State Department, the United Nations, and numerous humanitarian non-governmental organizations. Our representatives at the United Nations have repeatedly voted against the vast majority of the international community, including vetoing resolutions calling for a ceasefire. And administration leaders have even repeated unverified claims that systematically dehumanize Palestinians. Here is my resignation letter in it’s entirety. My words: — Tariq Habash (@tariqhabash_) Habash is now the second Biden official known to have resigned in protest over the administration’s response to the situation in Gaza. Josh Paul, who had worked at the State Department for 11 years,  in October, slamming the government for its “one-sided” policy that prioritized Israel at the expense of Palestinian civilians.“I cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that I believe to be short-sighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,” Paul said in a .Also in October, a director of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights , condemning the organization, the U.S., and Western media for their stance on the war. Craig Mokhiber, who had worked with the U.N. for more than three decades, called the situation in Gaza a “text-book case of genocide.”“Once again, we are seeing a genocide unfolding before our eyes, and the Organization that we serve appears powerless to stop it,” he said.Read Tariq Habash’s full letter .</p>

    <h1>The Far Right Is Growing Stronger—and Has a Plan for 2024</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In the last year, the far right has dropped off the radar of many Americans, as issues like the Israel-Hamas war, ongoing concerns about the economy, and the upcoming election have understandably dominated the headlines. The continuing January 6 arrests, trials, and convictions and Trump’s legal issues are mop-ups of crimes from years earlier. And while  are in the public consciousness, these issues are typically shrouded behind euphemisms like Another reason for this oversight is because far-right ideas have permeated American politics. Although the alt right , its goal of shifting the “Overton window”—the spectrum of what is —succeeded. Today, white supremacist, anti-LGBTQ+, and even antisemitic conspiracy theories have become so prevalent that what was taboo even in 2018 is accepted by many as not only normal but acceptable.However, observers of the far right are keenly aware of the movement’s continuing strength. For years many hoped the forces unleashed by Trump’s ascent in 2016 would reach a point of sudden collapse, as had happened in the past. These dreams were first pinned on Trump’s election losses (first in 2016 and then in 2020) and then on an expected delegitimization after the January 6, 2021, insurrection. But this has not been the case, and even in the absence of new high-profile events, the far right’s activist base has continued largely unfazed under President Biden. Looking at its organizations and strategies, as well as issues from the past year, shows what it will hit the ground running with as the 2024 presidential campaign heats up.Donald TrumpTrump remains the far right’s leading figure, commanding a devoted following and remaining the center of news coverage. Experts who watch the far right are concerned about possible violence if Trump does not become president. David Neiwert, author of , says that although he thinks it is unlikely that Trump will win, if he doesn’t his “hardcore supporters are going to engage in acts of domestic terrorism.” (If he is convicted and sentenced to jail time, Neiwert believes they may even go so far as to “try and break him out” of prison.) Journalist Teddy Wilson, publisher of , is only a little less circumspect, saying that “another mass casualty event” like the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168, is “hanging in the air.” And Professor Amy Cooter, author of , says she “would not be shocked” by violence following the election—although she hesitates to say it would be a certainty.If Trump does regain power, the threat he poses is exponentially greater. Wilson says that even those who’ve cooled on him, thanks to his failure to make good on promises like “building the wall,” are excited by his threats of revenge. Trump has already vowed to crown himself dictator (but only on ), take “retribution” against his enemies,  in the Department of Justice and elsewhere, and put  of federal jobs under his direct control. One of the most worrying recent developments is that what is now called the “MAGA movement,” which emerged in Trump’s wake, is no longer dependent on him. While it follows his politics, it acts politically without him. Its most visible elected politicians are members of Congress, particularly Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Paul Gosar. Of them, Greene has been able to garner the most attention, sharing the spotlight only with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who himself is waging a full-throated war against LGTBQ+ people and the state’s educational system. Trump’s ideas on issues like immigration and foreign policy have permeated the Republican Party to such an extent that they have dominated several GOP presidential debates that he himself has not participated in.The GrassrootsThe most popular focus of grassroots political work in 2023 was attacking LGBTQ+ issues, with a particular concentration on transgender rights. Wilson describes this overarching framework as “focused on children” who are being cynically “used to pursue policy goals.” These include the often successful takeovers of school boards, banning of library books (usually featuring LGBTQ+ content), and attempts to shut down drag events, which are claimed to “groom” children. The main organization driving these actions is Moms for Liberty, which was  in 2021 and has since grown  to .Moms for Liberty has forged close relations with the Proud Boys, who are now notorious after years of wanton street violence, Trump’s pre–January 6 nod to them to  and their subsequent role in storming the Capitol. In fact, the long sentences handed to multiple members for their pivotal role in the insurrection—leader Enrique Tarrio got —have not stymied their growth. Among other things, the Proud Boys have made significant inroads into local Republican Party structures. Since January 6,  have been charged for their role in the violent assault on the Capitol, with some receiving stiff sentences. For example, this spring Peter Schwartz—himself not a member of the Proud Boys—received  for attacking Capitol police with a folding chair and pepper spray. While it was hoped that these convictions would halt the far right’s momentum, this hope was quickly dashed as even mainstream Republicans came to the January 6 arrestees’ defense. In fact, Wilson says many of those imprisoned expect Trump to pardon them if he returns to the White House in 2025.CrimeOf course, even out of power the far right has continued to practice what it’s best known for: violence. White supremacist massacres in 2023 included one at a , dollar store (three killed) and one at a  shopping mall (eight killed). And this is in addition to individual murders like those of Laura Ann Carleton, who was killed for hanging a  outside her store.Enabled by online anonymity, threats toward anyone perceived as an enemy are now commonplace occurrences. While many are directed at , such as opponents of Jim Jordan’s nomination as speaker of the House, it’s now  to target judges, juries, teachers—even hospitals. According to the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center, last year federal prosecutions for these threats were the highest in a decade, and they are only expected to rise.Social MediaSocial media has greatly aided the rise in threatening language and online abuse. Large accounts like Libs of TikTok, which has 2.7 million X/Twitter followers, , inevitably leading to waves of threatening messages. Elon Musk’s purchase of that platform has . He’s brought back banned far-right accounts, loosened content moderation, and made increasingly racist and antisemitic posts himself. These reached a new low in November when he wrote that a post that claimed Jews were pushing “dialectical hatred” against whites through support for liberal immigration policies was the PunishmentEven beyond January 6, the far right has kept the legal system busy. Although well after the fact, some  from the 2017 Charlottesville rally were arrested earlier this year, including planned speaker and far-right activist . And three massacre perpetrators were sentenced. Robert Bowers, who in 2018 murdered 11 at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, received a  sentence. , who killed 23 at an El Paso Walmart in 2019, as well as , who killed five at Club Q in Denver in 2022, both received life in prison. So did , who committed one of four far-right murders in Portland, Oregon, between 2017 and 2022.LawsuitsPrivate citizens also spent the year using the legal system against the far right by pursuing civil action. Families of the Sandy Hook victims are continuing to try and make conspiracy-monger Alex Jones pay the  levied against him in 2022 for unleashing intense harassment against them by claiming the school shooting was a hoax. Militia leader Ammon Bundy of the People’s Rights Network was ordered to pay  for defaming St. Luke’s Health System, which led to ongoing threats against health care workers. And Patriot Front, a white supremacist group, has been  over what is alleged to have been a racially motivated assault during a Boston march.Militias, etc.While groups with mainstream connections like Moms for Liberty and the Proud Boys have received the greatest amount of attention, others are waiting in the wings, including the heavily armed militia movement. While Oath Keepers’ leader Stewart Rhodes made headlines for getting an  for seditious conspiracy for his role in January 6, the group’s importance has always been overstated. In fact, Cooter points out that a massive  in 2020 was much more harmful to the militia movement than Rhodes’s arrest. The militias have continued to organize more quietly, and she says it’s possible they will deploy armed “observers” at voting drop boxes in November.Two other strains related to militias have also seen upticks in 2023: Constitutional Sheriffs and Sovereign Citizens. The latter believe in a parallel legal system where they are exempt from almost all laws. Dr. Christine Sarteschi, an expert on this movement, notes that it is flourishing and is expected to continue to do so. It also has increasing global appeal and has spread to countries like Australia, Germany, and Russia. Sovereign Citizens originated in the same 1970s white supremacist group, Posse Comitatus, as the Constitutional Sheriffs movement; the latter holds that county sheriffs can decide which laws to enforce. This idea also did well in 2023, having further spread into mainstream law enforcement circles. In some places, sheriffs can now take  classes based on these ideas.Increasingly Ignored by the Mainstream, Right-Wing Edgelords Are Amassing Power Behind the ScenesLast, while the white supremacist movement has not received as much attention as it has in recent years, it continues to germinate as well. In September in Florida, Blood Tribe and the Goyim Defense League put on the largest, explicitly  in years. The comparatively moderate Patriot Front—merely fascists, as opposed to straight-up neo-Nazis—has remained active, despite receiving a black eye after  either took pleas or were convicted for attempting to crash a Pride event last year. Nick Fuentes—a Holocaust denier who has made impressive inroads into mainstream conservatism, even dining with Trump himself—made news by meeting with a  while the head of the Texas GOP was in the same building. But among white supremacists the year’s real winner was the Active Clubs, a loose network based around mixed martial arts and related training. It has quietly established about : Recently they have moved out of the ring and into increasingly public political activity.Wilson observes that the far right has taken close notes since January 6. Now they are better organized, their strategies have evolved, and they have a plan for what to do after taking power. Traditionally elections lift the boats of all kinds of grassroots movements, and with the far right so closely associated with Trump, this one will undoubtedly energize them. While it waits to be seen how everything unfolds, especially if Trump is convicted of one or more crimes, a close watch is in order.</p>

    <h1>Kellyanne Conway Thinks Americans Will Believe Almost Anything</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> It takes major audacity for Republican strategists to propose rebranding the GOP as pro-contraception. Yet that appears to be their plan for staving off electoral defeats over their anti-abortion successes. In December, some strategists began  a  from the consulting firm of onetime Trump staffer Kellyanne Conway, asking likely voters their views on abortion and birth control. The findings weren’t surprising: Most people said they support making birth control more accessible, including Republicans. But this group of strategists, which  Conway along with a lobbyist who once was chief of staff to Representative Tom DeLay and the head of the conservative group Independent Women’s Voice, claims this will help them convince Republican congressional candidates to campaign on contraception because it may help them hold onto their seats. Otherwise, as Politico  the group’s talking points to Republican candidates, they “risk losing voters and confirming arguments from the left that the party that outlawed abortion in much of the country is coming next for contraception.”To those who remember anything about the past decade or two in American politics, this is of course absurd. On the heels of the Dobbs decision overturning the right to abortion in 2022, 195 Republican congressional representatives , including birth control pills and condoms. This is the party that put judges like Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court, that used Dobbs to  overturning Supreme Court precedent on the right to birth control—an argument that the Arizona Republican Blake Masters, now running for Senate, has . Republicans have  of contraception. They have pushed federally funded HIV prevention programs to . Of course, Republicans don’t like it when you point to this record. When called out during the 2016 presidential primary on his , Ted Cruz accused the Democrats of inventing “condom police” just to scare people. “Back in my day, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives,” . “The gals put it between their knees, and it wasn’t that costly.” But this new, improbable pro-contraception strategy isn’t just another punch line. The  is a depressing but useful illustration of how far right the United States has slid on reproductive freedom. How grim, that we are to welcome as a moderate, for example, a Republican candidate who opposes .How exactly Conway would rebrand the GOP as pro-contraception when Republicans are actively working to stigmatize and criminalize birth control as  is a bit of a mystery. The reason Republicans’ messaging on contraception risks “confirming” that they want to ban it is because they have already confirmed this. Republicans are absolutely coming for birth control. They . And it’s anti-abortion groups who are  them.From a purely public relations perspective, it’s understandable that some Republicans would decide to emphasize the popular support for birth control, even among Republicans who oppose abortion. In a FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos  conducted in the weeks after the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs, 77 percent of respondents said birth control pills should be legal in all cases, along with 51 percent supporting emergency contraception in all cases. Republican respondents’ support for contraception was , but still, a majority of them wanted contraception to remain legal in all or most cases.But suggesting that candidates can rebrand like this ignores the fact that the Republican Party shows no signs of breaking with the anti-abortion groups who have set their policy agenda. These groups distinguish less and less these days between banning contraception and banning abortion. Look to “,” the presidential transition plan for the next conservative president, led by the Heritage Foundation, with  including Alliance Defending Freedom (which argued the Dobbs case as well as bringing numerous anti-LGBTQ discrimination cases), America First Legal (a Trump-backed project led by his onetime adviser Stephen Miller), and groups such as ALEC, FreedomWorks, Moms for Liberty, and Turning Point USA. Project 2025’s day-one policy  includes directing Congress to make drastic changes to Title X, the federal family planning program operating since 1970 to make contraception accessible, . Seventy percent of Title X patients are earning an income below the federal poverty level, The 19th recently ; for two-thirds of Title X patients, that will be their only health care that year. Trump  a gag rule on Title X, which banned Title X–funded programs from discussing abortion with patients, including with patients who specifically asked for information about abortion. This  Planned Parenthood and seven states to withdraw from Title X. Project 2025 seeks to restore and expand what Trump did to undermine Title X, such as forcing providers to promote marriage to their patients seeking contraception and making funding contingent on providers offering counseling to patients that only addresses how to continue a pregnancy to term or adoption.In the right-wing worldview, the only appropriate way to promote contraception is to tie access to contraception to promoting marriage and pregnancy. But Project 2025 also seeks to restrict contraception in general, deeming the one-pill prescription-only emergency contraceptive Ella a “potential abortifacient,” and claiming it is a “close cousin” to mifepristone, one of the pills used in medication abortion. This is misleading, since Ella, like Plan B, inhibits ovulation, which prevents pregnancy; mifepristone, by contrast, terminates pregnancy. Accurate medical information however is not the purpose of such a program; rather, using the fig leaf of contraception access, these programs gag health care providers and push misinformation, stigmatizing contraception and abortion. Warping “contraception access” in this way ultimately restricts access: According to Guttmacher, the Trump gag rule reduced Title X services nationally by about 46 percent, leading to  receiving contraception services, if they could not get services elsewhere.Conway et al.’s effort to push Republicans to message contraception access has been building for some time. In August, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley  in the Republican primary debate, as a way to evade discussion of abortion. Journalist Sarah Posner, who has long covered the right,  this “a transparent ploy to hoodwink voters,” one that should not be trusted. “The recent history of the GOP and its unbreakable bond with the Christian right,” she continued, “shows that the party has only grown more extreme on both abortion and contraception.” About a year ago, she noted, the Republican Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa also  attention from Politico for her support for making birth control pills available over the counter, part of what it said some Republicans had dubbed the “new pro-life agenda.” Two Washington Post columnists, one anti-abortion and one pro-abortion rights,  the phrase in September (along with “a pro-family agenda”), saying it was something that even those who disagree on abortion can support.But the idea that there’s a broad base of Republicans who would celebrate the end of Roe yet hail wider contraception access is a fantasy about a moderate party that no longer exists, if indeed it ever did: It’s worth noting that for all the good press, Governor Reynolds’s contraception access bill failed. And her support for the bill was always strategic: When  to the top Christian rights group in her state at an event celebrating the end of Roe, for example, Reynolds  about the six-week abortion ban she supported, but not her contraception bill, which this group opposed.Deceptive contraception-access policies backed by anti-abortion groups and Republicans have been building since long before the Trump administration, and any Republican president following the agenda set forth by leading conservative groups would continue and accelerate this trend. What good is “supporting contraception” when the larger political project is built on making contraception unavailable, pushing misinformation about contraception, and criminalizing an ever-increasing number of drugs and procedures? Republicans are counting on the media, donors, and supporters sticking to the approved messaging on this—that the party supports the use of contraceptives—and ignoring the people who suffer as a result of their actual policies. Win or lose an election, what they want is what the right has long desired: to leverage sex as a punitive force to exercise power over others and to reduce sex to a set of consequences and risks that they can dole out but always  themselves.</p>

    <h1>The Right Is Winning Its War on Schools</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Thu, 04 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Lindsey Burke’s job is to do things such as, when testifying before a House Education Committee in April,  that we should abolish the Department of Education. Burke, an education policy program director at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, was responding to a question from Democratic Representative Jamaal Bowman, after Burke had spoken in favor of “school choice.” Allowing parents to use public education funds to send their children to private schools—including religious schools—was, she argued, merely a way to enable families to “choose learning environments that are safe, and effective, and reflect their values.”A bit later, Bowman attempted to cut through the obfuscating rhetoric. The former public school teacher and principal asked, “Do you support the Department of Education?” Burke leaned into her mic and answered without a beat, “No—dissolve it.”Burke has celebrated defunding public education through “education savings accounts” as a way to “restore parental control” over education, a frame that contains both the typical free-market conservative argument against public education and the Christian right argument against exposing children to the immorality of “government schools.” In the decades-old fight against public education, a figure like Burke represents something of a united front.The linchpin in that fight is what is now called “parental rights.” In August 2022, at a Heritage event in Washington, Burke  a coalition working for what she called a new “values-based case for school choice.” In 2021, Burke  a paper with a colleague for the American Enterprise Institute that argued for “allowing families an escape hatch from government schools pushing an agenda that runs counter to their values,” like critical race theory and “transgender ideology.”This “values-based” coalition Burke said she was introducing in 2022 involved “not just education choice groups,” she explained, “but also groups like Moms for Liberty,” who  “parental rights” onto the agenda in school board elections while also aligning with the far right, and “partners” such as Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian nationalist law project  on anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion cases, which argued both the Dobbs case and a recent . These groups, Burke said, “understand that the school choice movement is the solution to current cultural battles.” Conveniently, these groups also instigated these “battles.”California has become a testing ground for this coalition. In her election campaign for school board in Chino Valley in the Southern California suburbs, Sonja Shaw  her support to Moms for Liberty. She became president of a school board tilted to favor what her political adviser  as “a spiritual battle.” When Shaw recently wanted to scold an opponent who questioned her proposed policy to out trans students without their consent, she  of supporting “things that pervert children.”Shaw is just one player in the larger national effort to demand that educators out trans students in the name of “parental rights.” Nearly 90 bills forcing teachers to monitor students’ gender expression—including dress, pronouns, and names—and report trans and gender-nonconforming students to parents were  in state legislatures across the country, according to PEN America’s Index of Educational Intimidation Bills. At least five states  these policies into law: North Dakota, Iowa, Alabama, North Carolina, and Indiana. What we are seeing in places like Chino Valley reflects a coordinated national plan to push laws and policies that would penalize educators who don’t go along—inverting their roles as mandatory reporters of harassment, neglect, and abuse at home.One model national policy for forced outing, the Given Name Act, was drafted by the Heritage Foundation, and it  when the measure passed in Arkansas in 2023. Elements of the forced outing policy feature in the Heritage-led agenda, Project 2025—the group’s  for the next conservative president. Project 2025 is “systematically preparing to march into office and bring a new army, aligned, trained, and essentially weaponized conservatives ready to do battle against the deep state,” project director Paul Dans . Burke herself is the author of Project 2025’s Education Plan. Its directives include statements such as: “Federal lawmakers should not allow public school employees to keep secrets about a child from that child’s parents.” The model policy includes two provisions that forbid school employees from using any name “other than the name listed on a student’s birth certificate” or a pronoun that is “different from that student’s biological sex without the written permission of a student’s parents or guardians.”As a tool of gender conformity and as a moral panic about the content of public education, these policies hit a sweet spot for the right—which may explain why more established conservative groups are stepping up to promote and defend them.Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, has  the policy in the Chino Valley school district in court. In his complaint, filed in August, Bonta  that transgender and gender-nonconforming students “are in real fear that the District’s policy will force them to make a choice: either ‘walk back’ their constitutionally and statutorily protected rights to gender identity and gender expression, or face the risk of emotional, physical, and psychological harm from non-affirming or unaccepting parents or guardians.” (In September, a state judge  enforcement of the policy on these grounds.)The Chino Valley school district  to Liberty Justice Center to represent it. Liberty Justice Center is a frequent litigation partner of the conservative think tank Illinois Policy Institute, which housed it until 2018—both receive significant funding from the Republican megadonor Richard Uihlein.* Shaw has  other school districts to pass forced outing policies, saying Liberty Justice Center would represent them if they were challenged.The right’s mission to eradicate public education is in many ways inseparable from their accelerating attacks on LGBTQ rights and racial justice. Perhaps there is no better symbol of that intersection than Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who has boasted about writing the playbook: moving from using critical race theory as a rallying cry for white grievance against schools, then similarly  accusations that LGBTQ-inclusive schools are “grooming” young people. Rufo revels in “laying siege to the institutions” as strategy, as he  in a 2022 speech at the conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan. “We go in there and we defund things we don’t like, we fund things we do like.”In January, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis  Rufo as a member of the board of trustees of New College in Sarasota, a public liberal arts college and frequent right-wing scapegoat. Rufo was charged with remaking the school—and making an example of it. In May, DeSantis pointedly  as where he would sign a law that banned the state’s public colleges and universities from using public funds to “advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or promote or engage in political or social activism.” New College  more than a third of its faculty ahead of the fall semester, thanks to moves by Rufo. DeSantis  the “replacement of far-left faculty with new professors aligned with the university’s mission.”New College is hardly alone. Around the same time, the board of governors of West Virginia University became the symbol for attacks on higher ed pitched as simply remaking the university. The board ultimately  28 majors and 10 minors, along with hundreds of faculty and staff positions. The humanities bore the brunt, but students in many other areas of study will lose access to resources as a result. Unsurprisingly, university president E. Gordon Gee attempted to downplay such cuts. He  that the university must explore “modern ways of delivering content” to students, like partnering with a for-profit language learning app. But as one undergraduate student who said she came to WVU for its Chinese department , “They’re not just destroying education, they’re destroying a community.”Drafting faculty to police students’ gender and sexuality, cutting humanities departments and libraries, handing university governance over to far-right think tankers are forms of what geographer and abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore  “organized abandonment.” Whether those educators and other staff who have a choice in the matter stay or leave, they are forced into enacting that abandonment. Schools are hollowed out and then held up as symbols of decay. Then the finger is pointed back at the educators: The students are being failed, and it’s their fault.“Stoking fears about the imperiled parental control of children has been second nature on the American right for more than a century,”  education scholar Jennifer Berkshire this year in The Nation. She notes that the Heritage Foundation touched down in West Virginia back when Heritage was still new, to whip up parents over alleged textbook “indoctrination.” The group’s members tried to make “parental rights” happen again in the 1990s by pushing amendments to state constitutions. Here they are now—again saying they’re doing something new. History is invisible to them, as they want it to be for the rest of us.  *This article has been updated to clarify the relationship between the Liberty Justice Center and Illinois Policy Institute.</p>

    <h1>Nikki Haley Is So Unhinged She Renamed Her Husband</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 22:33:54 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley is apparently willing to sacrifice just about anything for her political career—even her husband’s name.In a true Selina Meyer move, the former South Carolina governor apparently decided that her then boyfriend’s name wasn’t fashionable enough for her political motivations.“You may be wondering how ‘Bill’ became South Carolina First Gentleman Michael Haley,” Haley wrote in her autobiographical 2012 book, Can’t Is Not an Option: My American Story.She then outlines how she suddenly decided he no longer looked like a Bill, opting instead to call him by his second name, Michael, which her friends quickly adopted.Nikki Haley renamed her husband — Andrew Prokop (@awprokop) “From that point on, I started calling him Michael, and all my friends did the same. When he transferred to Clemson his sophomore year, my friends became his friends, and before we knew it, he was universally known as Michael,” Haley wrote.“He looks like a Michael,” she added.</p>

    <h1>Republican Candidate Keeps Stealing Other People’s Food Photos, Calling Them Hers</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 21:40:18 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> U.S. House candidate Mayra Flores got caught up in a sticky situation on Wednesday when it became apparent that the Mexican-born politician has been ripping and reposting photos of Mexican food from other online accounts, all while claiming it as her own cooking.The Texas Republican, who is running again for the seat she previously held from 2022 to 2023 representing Texas’s 34th congressional district, was called out in several posts on Twitter that tied photos of self-proclaimed, self-made grub from her Instagram account to other sources online.“The ranch life with family is the best,” Flores captioned one photo of corn flour gorditas cooking over a wood-burning fire pit, although the photo was posted more than a year earlier to a Guyana tourism Facebook page.Very bizarre: Apparently former congresswoman and current U.S. House candidate Mayra Flores has for years been posting stolen food pics  — Robert Downen (@RobertDownen_) In another post sharing a photo of eggs and tortillas, Flores claimed she was a “proud Latina who knows how to cook,” adding that “homemade Mexican food tastes better from a gas stove.”Except that photo too was ripped from another source and was originally posted on Facebook in 2021 by .Flores has deleted at least one of the stolen photos since online sleuths began taking note.Here’s  trying to convince people that she’s living the high life and making dinner over an open fire at the ranch. Only problem is: this picture was stolen from a Guyanese facebook page. Why would you lie, Mayra? — Ben Anderson (@ben_the_dem) In a text messaged statement, Flores told the  it wasn’t her “intention to mislead.”“The photo simply reminded me of my upbringing in Mexico and childhood,” she added. “I deleted the tweet to clear up any confusion. I actually spend my Christmas at ranch with my In-Laws. Happy New Year!”When asked to specify which photos she was referring to, Flores told the Tribune to turn its attention toward the border.It’s a strange twist for a politician who previously accused first lady Jill Biden of allegedly believing you can win over Latinos with food.“[Democrats] think that by giving us tacos, playing Latin music, that’s all it’s going to take for us to vote for them. It’s not,” Flores told  in August 2022.</p>

    <h1>DeSantis Turns Next-Level Extremist, Promises to Bring Back Operation Wetback</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 21:10:46 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ron DeSantis wants to bring back an extreme 1950s-era immigration policy that saw the mass deportation of up to 1.3 million migrants.During a Wednesday night town hall, DeSantis floated the idea of resurrecting President Dwight Eisenhower’s racist-named “.” That program sparked the largest mass deportation in U.S. history, as authorities employed military-style tactics to deport Mexican immigrants, some of whom had been naturalized.When asked if every undocumented migrant would be deported, DeSantis , “Everybody is subject to that.”“We’re gonna do the Biden eight million, that’s a big task,” he , referring to the Republican estimate that eight million migrants have supposedly entered the country during Joe Biden’s time in office. “Eisenhower had a program in the ’50s, so we’re gonna do that.”Anywhere from 300,000 to 1.3 million people were deported under Operation Wetback, which lasted for three months in 1954. Historians say it is impossible to know exactly how many people were forcibly removed, because some people reentered the U.S. and were deported again.The  disrupted families, communities, and U.S. business operations that relied on migrant labor. Tens of thousands of people were sent to random parts of Mexico, where they struggled to find their footing. The conditions in which they were detained and transported were brutal, and thousands of people died from sunstroke and disease.DeSantis has promised repeatedly to crack down on immigration, often in cruel and inhumane ways. This is the second time he is  the idea of bringing back Eisenhower’s policy. He also  in September that the United States shoot alleged cartel members on sight at the border. DeSantis offered no details on how to actually identify a cartel member by sight alone.The Florida governor doubled down Wednesday on his terrible immigration policy ideas in an op-ed for the . He promised to declare a national emergency over immigration, crack down on asylum requests, and to finish building the border wall and make Mexico pay for it. DeSantis also threatened consequences for Mexico and other Central American countries for letting so many migrants reach the U.S. border.“Florida under my leadership has been a bulwark of immigration enforcement,” DeSantis bragged. “I sent illegal aliens out of Florida’s communities and to so-called ‘sanctuary cities,’ such as Martha’s Vineyard. And I signed the strongest anti-illegal immigration legislation in the country.”He failed to mention that he has been accused of  by sending migrants to other states. Massachusetts officials are urging the Justice Department to look into Desantis’s actions.Many of Florida’s new immigration laws have disrupted businesses, with farmers saying that migrant workers are avoiding the Sunshine State altogether. Backlash has been so bad that even Republican lawmakers have  they messed up.</p>

    <h1>2024 Kicks Off With Insane Number of Bomb Threats at State Capitols</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 18:52:48 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Six states received bomb threats to their state capitols on Wednesday morning, forcing them to stall their newly opened legislative sessions and evacuate their capitol complexes.Those states included Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Connecticut, and Montana. No evidence of dangerous items were immediately found, officials said.“There have been multiple bomb threats to state capitols around the nation. So far Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan & Montana,” said Georgia’s Secretary of State Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling in a statement on . “Do not jump to conclusions as to who is responsible. There will be chaos agents sowing discord for 2024. They want to increase tensions. Don’t let them.”While the mass threat against elected officials is certainly a shocking way to begin the year, it’s actually a part of a growing trend. Data reported by the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education, or NCITE, Center  that violent threats against public officials have been on the rise since they began collecting data in 2013.In the last decade, 501 threats against public officials have resulted in federal charges, with 80 percent of those ending in convictions, according to NCITE.“We have had an astounding number of threats against public servants for the last several years,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland told a Republican-controlled congressional committee in September.“When they are singled out, this can lead to threats of violence and actual violence,” Garland said, referring to the  who attempted to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati office shortly after the federal law enforcement agency seized documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property.“We must not allow that to happen in this country,” he added.</p>

    <h1>Conservatives Are Having a Meltdown Over Trump and the Epstein List</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 17:54:58 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Several of Donald Trump’s biggest fans seem increasingly frantic about a forthcoming list divulging the names of those who traveled on Epstein’s plane and visited his various international estates.In social media posts and public appearances, several MAGA talking heads have made it clear that Trump’s highly anticipated presence on such a list, which is expected to contain nearly 200 names, is at the front of their minds.On Tuesday, the former president’s son turned fingers toward Bill Clinton, who has also been photographed alongside the serial rapist.“Everyone knows Bill Clinton was on Jeffrey Epstein’s [planes] and island a lot. Literally no one is at all surprised that he’s all over the release,” Don Jr.  on X. “What we want to know is ALL THE OTHER NAMES that the government has been hiding & running cover for. That will actually be revealing!”InfoWars host and Trump sycophant Alex Jones also made some noise on the issue, apparently having a hard time rationalizing how the known womanizer could have been associated with Epstein.“I will say this, if it turns out Trump ever went to Epstein Island, I will remove any support from him,” Jones said. “But I know Roger Stone very well, and I know people that know Trump well, a lot of people, I’ll leave it at that. I know women that have dated Trump, prominent women.”“He gets devoted to one woman at a time, gets totally obsessed with them, totally nice to them,” Jones continued, apparently ignoring the fact that Trump is due for a criminal trial this year on the basis of paying hush money to a porn star with whom he reportedly had an affair.Other conservatives seemed equally flabbergasted at the anticipated unveiling, attempting to frame a new conspiracy to avoid confronting the reality of Trump’s behavior.“High chance that the Epstein filings will include Donald Trump’s name. Out of context, the legacy media and TDS sufferers will pretend this isn’t because he gave willing testimony against Epstein when queried and will make believe that it makes him a pervert,”  X user  to much conspiratorial head-nodding.That’s compared to the dozens of instances in which Trump was photographed partying alongside Epstein and Maxwell and recorded on the socialite’s plane, dubbed the “Lolita Express,” while surrounded by . He also described the pedophile peddler as a “.”Other MAGA headliners were so upset by the list that they ceased making any sense at all, including Tomi Lahren, who insinuated that the list includes Trump only as a diversionary tactic.“So, what do you think they’re going to go after Trump for next to bury the Epstein document dump and all the pedophiles on it?” Lahren posted on . “Every time they want to cover their tracks, they go after Trump.”The list of Jane and John Does, which was formed nearly nine years ago after Virginia Giuffre filed a defamation claim against Epstein’s girlfriend and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, was originally set to be published on Tuesday but has since been postponed until after January 22, according to .Many of the names are expected to be publicly known Epstein associates, including employees of the financier. Other possible names to be unveiled could include Epstein’s victims as well as his clients and perpetrators. The latter will likely include some public figures who have already been explicitly tied to the sex trafficker, including British Prince Andrew and, of course, Donald Trump.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> It seems that  is finally opening up to the idea of a two-state solution to its conflict with Palestine—so long as the second state is on a completely different continent.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition has been secretly speaking with the Democratic Republic of Congo about resettling thousands of Palestinians in the African nation, the Israeli outlet Zman Israel  Wednesday.“Congo will be willing to take in migrants, and we’re in talks with others,” a senior source in the security Cabinet, speaking anonymously, said. and his allies floated the idea of sending Palestinians elsewhere last week, but the idea has been vehemently rejected by the international community. Moreover, Congo is unlikely to have the resources necessary to take care of such a massive influx of displaced people. More than half of the country’s population lives below the poverty line,  to the World Food Programme. Israeli officials have made it increasingly clear in recent days that their plan is to completely eliminate . Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday that a way to solve the war was to “encourage the voluntary migration of Gaza’s residents to countries that will agree to take in the refugees.”Separately, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir told reporters Monday that the war was an “opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza.”The U.S. State Department slammed the officials’ comments as “inflammatory” and “irresponsible.”“We have been told repeatedly and consistently by the Government of Israel, including by the Prime Minister, that such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government. They should stop immediately,” department spokesman Matthew Miller  in a statement.But it seems that Smotrich and Ben Gvir’s statements do reflect the policy of the Israeli government. Nearly all of the  living in the Gaza Strip have been displaced due to Israel’s unrelenting bombardment of the region. Palestinians were forced to flee to designated “safe zones,” only for Israel to  those areas, as well.South Africa  the International Court of Justice on December 29 for an urgent order declaring that Israel is committing genocide against  in its nearly three-month assault on the Gaza Strip.

    <h1>The Republican Party Is Quickly Collapsing in Michigan</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 17:08:40 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Michigan’s state Republican Party is falling into complete disarray as the Michigan GOP state committee  to remove its party chair, who claims that such a move is unlawful.The committee has scheduled a special meeting for Saturday to vote on whether to remove Chair Kristina Karamo. But Karamo argued Tuesday that the meeting has not been lawfully scheduled, and threatened not to abide by the result of the vote.Karamo has served less than one year of her two-year term. A 2020 election denier and ardent Donald Trump supporter, she ran unsuccessfully for secretary of state in 2022. A few months later, she was elected as the Republican Party’s chairperson.Her short tenure has been plagued with problems. Her fellow party members have accused her of a lack of transparency and organization, autocratic rule, and even interference with county party business.In October, Karamo  the party was nearly $500,000 in debt. Her opponents slammed her for seemingly failing to do anything to improve the party’s finances.In a sign of how little support she has from her own Republicans, eight of the 13 district chairs and her own party co-chair signed a letter calling for Karamo’s ousting.“You were chosen as chairwoman because the majority of the Republican delegates strongly respected your commitment to a new era of transparency, honesty and meaningful involvement on the part of the State Committee,” the letter . “Regrettably, these policies no longer seem to be a priority in your administration and the Party’s financial stability is quickly deteriorating.”Karamo pushed back, claiming Tuesday that the meeting had not been called according to party rules. She  the Detroit Free Press that the people who called the meeting “have zero legal authority to conduct business regarding the Michigan Republican Party or its State Committee.”Under party bylaws, 75 percent of the party must vote against Karamo to remove her. If Karamo refuses to recognize the meeting and its result, it could spark a legal battle over party leadership.</p>

He had previously recorded his shows out of his home in Long Island and would go to Fox News’s Manhattan headquarters for live shows.“I’ve been threatening now to do this for quite a while, but we are now beginning our first broadcast from my new home, and that is in the free state of Florida,” Hannity  on his radio show. “I am out.

    <h1>Trump’s Idiot Lawyer Just Admitted He May Be Guilty of Insurrection</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 15:15:37 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> One of Donald Trump’s lawyers appeared to accidentally admit that the  may have engaged in insurrection.Christina Bobb, a vocal 2020 , tried to argue Tuesday night that voters should be able to elect anyone they want for president.“The president is elected by the entire nation, and it should be the entire nation who determines who they want for president, whether they are guilty of insurrection or not,” Bobb said during an interview on Real America’s Voice. “It’s up to the people.”Trump attorney Christina Bobb: “The president is elected by the entire nation and it should be the entire nation who determines who they want for president, whether they are guilty of insurrection or not.” — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) Bobb seems to be arguing that even an insurrectionist should be allowed to run the country, which could be seen as an admission of guilt.Trump was recently  from the primary ballots in Colorado and Maine, after the  and  determined that he had engaged in insurrection and was therefore constitutionally ineligible to run for president.The issue of his eligibility is likely headed to the Supreme Court. Trump  the Maine decision Tuesday, and the Colorado Republican Party has  the nation’s high court to review their state’s decision.Bobb’s blunder is not the first time that one of Trump’s lawyers, or even Bobb herself, has undermined one of his lawsuits.

Trump was arraigned in Washington on August 3 for allegedly attempting to overthrow the 2020 election. His defense stems from his claim that he genuinely believed he had won.But outside the courthouse, attorney Alina Habba confidently stated, “I think that everybody was made aware that he lost the election.”And just two days earlier, Trump’s lawyer John Lauro decided the best defense is just to admit to everything. Lauro bluntly  that Trump had pressured  to delay certifying the votes (which is against the law) and had tried to use fake electors (also illegal).</p>

    <h1>Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene Offers Pathetic Excuse for Stock Trading</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 15:08:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene pulled the old “I’m holding it for a friend” excuse when prompted to explain why she was listed among members of Congress with suspiciously .On Tuesday, the market analysis watchdog Unusual Whales dropped its annual review of the biggest market traders on Capitol Hill. Democrat lawmakers’ outpaced Republicans’ gains in no small part due to Representative Brian Higgins’s portfolio, which outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 10 times. But quite a few Republicans also made it to the list, including none other than Taylor Greene.When questioned about appearing on the list, however, Greene pointed a finger at her son.“I asked my team about that today, about why my name was on the list because I don’t even own any stocks, and I haven’t all of 2023,” Greene said on Fox News’s Jesse Waters Primetime. “As a matter of fact we have to report everything, including children who are dependents of ours, and I think what was reported was actually related to my son’s account that his father and I had set up for him years ago,” Greene added.Greene: I actually asked my team about that today why my name was on the list because I don't even own stocks. And I haven't all of 2023… — Acyn (@Acyn) To Greene’s credit, Unusual Whales doesn’t list any new transactions out of  for the duration of 2023, though the MAGA politician has made more than a handful of purchases since she took office in 2021 and doesn’t seem to have sold them. That probably explains why she’s ranked on the list, which measures overall returns for the year—not transactions. But all these gross expenditures and unusually timed trades begs the question: How are our politicians making such informed choices?Technically, it’s illegal for lawmakers to buy and sell stock based on nonpublic information. In 2012, President Barack Obama signed the STOCK Act, preventing members of Congress from trading based on details obtained through their work, like committee work or entertaining lobbyists.But as long as a trade is reported in 45 days, U.S. legislators are free to trade however they want, even if the bills they pass or reject could influence a company’s performance and help them line their own pockets.</p>

    <h1>The Polls Prove It: Many Republicans Love Fascism</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> It is no longer controversial to speak plainly about the authoritarian shift of the Republican Party, led by Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton was dragged in 2016 for , “You could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.… The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic—you name it.” When Biden  the “extreme MAGA philosophy” as “semi-fascism” earlier this year, hardly anyone blinked. This is in part due to a shift in the conventional wisdom about Trump and partly due to Trump and the GOP not even bothering to try to hide their authoritarian aims anymore.Trump has referred to his opponents as “” who are trying to “destroy America and to destroy the American dream,” and  that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our nation.” The  overtones have   . And yet, the man who promises to be a  leads the GOP primary by . How could this be? The horrifying conclusion is that there is plenty of appetite within the party for this sort of rhetoric and it doesn’t turn many people off. Surveys back this up. A recent poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers found that  of them were more likely to vote for Trump based on his assertion that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country. Twenty-nine percent said the comments don’t matter, and 28 percent responded that it would make them less likely to vote for him. In a national poll,  of Republicans identified themselves as “MAGA” conservatives. Which is to say, Hillary was correct. About half of Republicans hear Trump’s rhetoric and think, “Yes, this exactly what I want.” These are the Americans who believe they should be forever atop the social and political order because of their race and/or religion and are angry at society for changing in ways that have leveled the playing field even a little. Trump  these voters that “I am your retribution,” and they are planning to hold him to it.Which is to say, an unbreakable plurality of the GOP explicitly wants fascism. Another 29 percent are OK with it as long as it doesn’t directly affect them (though I expect a lot of them are going to unexpectedly get their faces eaten by leopards). And of the remaining 28 percent who don’t like it, Trump’s approval ratings within the GOP as president suggest that  for him anyway in November 2024.Some might point out that only  of U.S. voters are registered as Republicans. True, but Republican-leaning independents constitute another 17 percent, and actual swing voters are . So the best-case scenario is that only 14 percent of voters are really dedicated to installing a fascist dictatorship. However, history tells us that that is a sufficient critical mass to send a country spinning into horror. When  visited Germany in the early 1950s to interview former low-level members of the Nazi party, he concluded that perhaps only a million out of 70 million Germans were “Fanatiker” (fanatics or true believers)—the rest were just along for the perks or to simply avoid unwanted scrutiny for lack of ideological purity.In my own experience as an analyst in U.S. Central Command who studied insurgency, I estimated that you only needed 10 to 15 percent of the population to be supportive of the insurgents to get a situation like what I saw in Iraq in 2005–2006. In short, you don’t need all that many people dedicated to dictatorship, theocracy, or any other awful possibility to absolutely collapse a country into barbarism. (I have few other words for the horrors I saw committed by insurgents in Iraq over that time period.)Which leaves us where we are today. One party is dedicated to bringing about a dictatorship that plans to seize power for “,” purging society of the enemies that are purportedly destroying the nation from within. The other party is a vaguely center-left coalition, too weak to bring about effective change because the country’s Constitution and societal fragmentation make it politically and legally impossible. As bad as this is, I haven’t even gotten to the really depressing part. Most people assume that if fascism came to America, we would recognize it as individuals and refuse to go along with it. In reality, very few people are directly affected by living in an authoritarian country; life is mostly “” for the majority. “Yes,” most people would say, “but if asked to do things I know were wrong, I would refuse to comply. Because I’m an American, and I know better.”Except, we’re already testing this every day in red states, and failing miserably. Let’s discuss a scenario that is already happening frequently.A woman goes into the E.R. She’s 18 weeks pregnant, her water broke, and she’s miscarrying. There’s no way to save the fetus. She’s likely to either bleed out or die of sepsis if left untreated. A doctor assesses her and quickly reaches this conclusion. But because there’s a heartbeat (for now), he can do nothing. The doctor calls hospital administrators. They pass it along to general counsel. Counsel comes back with the determination that there are greater civil and criminal liability risks if they perform a  than if the woman dies from lack of treatment. This is passed to the administrators, who passes it to the doctor, who tells the woman to go wait in the car until she’s  and then maybe he can treat her, if there isn’t a fetal heartbeat.The doctor knows this is wrong at a fundamental level. The hospital administrators probably do as well. The woman is very likely to die, painfully and slowly, from gross neglect. But the doctor is just following orders from the administrators. The administrators are just following orders from counsel. Counsel is acting on the raw calculus that the state attorney general will never grant a life of the mother exception, and that there’s less risk if she dies in the parking lot than if she’s alive in the hospital. Neither the state legislators nor the attorney general can be held criminally or civilly liable for the suffering and death that they cause. Nor can the legislators ever be removed from office, because of gerrymandering.Ultimately, when the power of the state comes to bear on people, including Americans, the vast majority will not do the right thing. Most (sane) people admire , but when confronted with the reality of how fascism corrupts ordinary men, almost no one emulates his willingness to do the right thing by defying the state. When Trump takes power and turns the full might of the government against anyone who might resist, the guardrails of individual conscience will evaporate faster than a snow flurry in hell.</p>

    <h1>There’s Nothing Undemocratic About Barring Trump From the Ballot</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Colorado Supreme Court’s  disqualifying Donald Trump from the ballot, and the similar  by Maine’s secretary of state, have been widely denounced by various members of the pundit class as undemocratic. There are plenty of grounds for worry about these decisions, but this can’t be one of them. These critics’ fears about what’s at stake as far as our democracy is concerned have been badly misplaced: It is only because of democracy-thwarting provisions of the Constitution that Trump has any hope of becoming president again.These decisions have been criticized, on grounds of democracy, even by   who  Trump as a threat to America. They make what may be called the Argument From Democracy: Trump must be stopped, but the appropriate—indeed, the optimal—way for that to happen is for the voters themselves to consider and reject him. A “Get Out of a Second Trump Term Free” card from the judiciary simply won’t do. Even The New York Times’ generally reliable Charlie Savage  that the ruling “pits one fundamental value against another: giving voters in a democracy the right to pick their leaders versus ensuring that no one is above the law.” Kurt Lash likewise , “Let the people make their own decision about Donald Trump.”They don’t seem to notice that the people have already rendered their own decision, precisely by the gold-standard means they all suggest. They rejected Trump twice. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got nearly three million more votes than he did. Four years later, Joe Biden beat him by more than seven million votes.It’s only because of the Electoral College, an  constitutional relic, that the American people do not get to make their own decision, by majority vote. If they did, then a party as extreme as today’s Republicans could never hope to secure the presidency, or for that matter the Senate. They are only as potent a force—and an undemocratic force at that—because the Electoral College . If, in 2020, Trump had won 45,000 additional votes in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, .A similar scenario in 2024 is his most promising path back to the White House. What those making the Argument From Democracy have glossed over, in fact, is that it is exceedingly likely that a majority of Americans will reject Trump for a third time. It is, however, quite possible that they will be thwarted again by the Electoral College. If that is Trump’s path to the presidency—and it is probably his only possible path—it would be yet another defeat for democracy.I express no view here about the legal merits of the decisions handed down by Colorado or Maine—though The New Republic’s Matt Ford has argued that . I will simply note that the Argument From Democracy has nothing to do with those legal merits. It is really just an objection to the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment that bars insurrectionists from office. But if we are going to allow our Constitution to organize our politics in undemocratic ways, then the same reasons apply even when the undemocratic ways are less familiar.Were Trump to be excluded from a ballot, Trump voters would of course claim that they have been cheated. But they will claim that anyway, in any possible scenario in which Trump does not win reelection. He will lie about the outcome, and they will believe him. We have already run this experiment.  think the 2020 election was stolen by Joe Biden, even though that claim was rejected by every judge it came before, including Trump’s own appointees. These voters are insulated from reality here, as with climate change, vaccination, and many other issues.There are good reasons to worry about the consequences of Trump’s disqualification from the ballot. It’s hard to predict what might happen if the Supreme Court upholds it. Plausible, scary possibilities abound. Some states would doubtless defy it and nominate Trump anyway. Some Trump supporters would respond the way they did on January 6. But here, we are no longer talking about democracy or law. The problem of how to manage Trump’s supporters is like the problem of how to prevent China from invading Taiwan, or to keep Hamas from again committing mass murder and rape. Where the rule of law is insecure, the question of how to handle violent, unscrupulous bullies is a prudential one. Of course, the most dangerous of those bullies is Trump himself. There is no rule book in such matters. Anyone who has no doubts about how to handle them misunderstands the chaotic contingency of human affairs.At the level of principle, however, the question of whether democracy should be checked by the Fourteenth Amendment’s disqualification clause is just like the question of whether, because of the Electoral College, the American people should be ruled by a president that most of them voted against. In each case, the rule of law depends on accepting the imperfect system of law we have inherited. The disqualification clause is less well known, but that’s only because since the Civil War there hasn’t been a presidential candidate who deployed mob violence to try to steal an election. But there’s another distinction worth noting: The Electoral College provisions of the Constitution have become a pointless dead weight, their  forgotten and irrelevant. By contrast, the disqualification clause is highly relevant—even prescient—and it would be serving the very purpose for which it was enacted: to bar those who have attempted to destroy America’s government, thereby betraying their oaths of office, from ever again participating in that government.</p>

    <h1>Israel’s “Right to Exist” Is a Rhetorical Trap</h1>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> Wed, 03 Jan 2024 11:00:00 +0000</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> “There can be no genuine peace in the Middle East until the Arab states abandon the policy of hostility to Israel and show by deeds and words readiness to accept Israel’s right to exist,” Abba Eban, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, told the Overseas Writers Club in Washington in 1955. Sixty-six years later, Dani Dayan, the Israeli consul general in New York,  in The New York Times, “The day Palestinians accept Israel’s right to exist as the legitimate homeland of the Jewish people, a real peace process will begin.” Through the intervening years of wars, invasions, occupation, peace processes, and treaties, Israel’s right to exist has stubbornly endured. Just last month, the House of Representatives passed a  that “denying Israel’s right to exist is a form of antisemitism.” The phrase and its long history compels us to ask: What does it mean for a nation to “exist,” and who judges its right to do so? Republican Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey  recently that “Israel is the only state in the world whose fundamental right to exist, within any borders at all, is openly denied by other states.” But Israel is the only nation with a “right to exist,” as the phrase is not commonly attached to any other country. And that’s the tell: This is not a legal concept, but a political one, available for broad interpretation and rhetorical weaponization. The “right to exist” as a nation is, as the Palestinian scholar Edward Said once wearily  it, “a formula hitherto unknown in international or customary law.” Rights pertain to individuals, not countries. And universal rights can’t, by definition, belong to some peoples and not others. It’s one of the great ironies, then, of the Israel-Palestine conflict that Israel seems untouchable by international law as it —it suffers no sanctions for   of Geneva Convention prohibitions against settlements in the occupied West Bank—but is so fulsomely protected by a statute of international law that is basically made up.However intensely Israel feels under threat, its right to exist is meaningless as a matter of law. Its realest meaning is as a flexible piece of political rhetoric. One consistency in its use over the years is that Israel’s “right to exist” is always invoked negatively, as a thing someone somewhere denies or won’t accept. It’s most typically used to characterize Arab and Palestinian intransigence or dogmatism. After Israel’s resounding victory in the 1967 Six-Day War against Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, Egypt’s foreign minister  the press in obvious exasperation:Perhaps we have not said this loudly enough or plainly enough.... That this document [the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement of 1949] would guarantee the right of Israel to exist is self-evident. We do know Israel exists, we have signed a piece of paper. We did not sign it with shadows.Palestine Liberation Organization President Yasir Arafat sounded a similar note in 1988, after an official  that the Palestinian National Council “accepted the existence of Israel as a state in the region.” “The PNC accepted two states, a Palestinian state and a Jewish state, Israel,” Arafat . “Is that clear enough?” Apparently, it was not. The specific meaning of the phrase relies a lot on things unsaid or implied: Both the nature of the supposed refusal and the implication that denying Israel’s “right to exist” means denying Jews’. It also depends a lot on the dependent clauses that come after that word: “as a state,” “in peace and security,” or “as a Jewish state”?In 1993, as a precondition of the Oslo peace negotiations, the PLO recognized the “right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security,” a declaration based on the 1967 U.N. Joint Resolution 242 that affirms every Middle Eastern nation’s “right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.” As the peace process collapsed, and Israeli politics moved sharply to the right, the country’s parliament passed its so-called “Nation-State Law,” which declared that “the exercise of the right to national self-determination in the State of Israel is exclusive to the Jewish people.” The goalposts of “existence” had moved considerably. Now Israel’s right to national self-determination—its national right to exist, if you like—seemed to explicitly reject Palestine’s. How could Palestinians accept this right without denying their own? In a column in October, The New York Times’ Bret Stephens  of activists (many of them Jews) protesting Israel’s latest bombardment of Gaza: “‘Anti-occupation’ is opposition to Israel’s right to exist in any form.” Here, the “right to exist” is used to insinuate that those critical of Israel’s policies in Gaza are antisemitic. That is the rhetorical trap that Israel’s “right to exist” has always set for the country’s critics: On the one hand, reject Israel’s “right to exist,” and risk being accused of rejecting Jews’ human rights to exist; on the other, accept Israel’s right to exist and risk accepting whatever interpretation a future audience will choose to make of the phrase’s ever-changing meaning.Questions of “existence” are typically left to theologians and philosophers, for good reason—pinning treaty obligations on issues of metaphysics is a recipe for confusion. So what can we say with honesty? Israel has no right to exist because no nation does; only people do. Israelis exist; so do Palestinians. They all have a right to exist but only because they are human beings. And there is no justice in securing your own right to exist by denying it to others. </p>
