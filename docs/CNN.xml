When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.

"Barry" has taken chances from the very beginning, which is certainly true of a fourth and final season that picks up where the third left off, with its hitman-turned-wannabe actor getting arrested.
