<title>House Republicans Only Have One Way out of Their Government Funding Debacle</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <p>Mike Johnson should have seen this coming. In October, the then backbencher became speaker of the House after far-right radicals ousted Kevin McCarthy for the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/175954/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-expelled-vote-got-deserved">crime of negotiating with the Biden administration</a> to keep the government open. Now Johnson is on the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/12/mike-johnson-spending-republicans-shutdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">verge of being deposed himself</a>—for the crime of negotiating with Senate Democrats to keep the government open.</p><p><span>More than a year into one of the </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/118th-congress-track-become-productive-us-history/story?id=106254012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">least productive Congresses</a><span> in American history, it is exceedingly clear that House Republicans both have no interest in governing and are themselves ungovernable. With the possible exception of Donald Trump, there is no one within the GOP who can keep its various factions in line. There is certainly no one within the current Republican House who has the political capital to strike a deal with Democrats to fulfill Congress’s most basic responsibility—keeping the government open—while retaining the necessary support from GOP members. </span><br /></p><p><span>Given that this is an election year, shutting down the government and having another protracted period in which there is no speaker of the House (or both!) would be an exceptionally bad look for Republicans, who are—again, theoretically—making the case to voters this fall that they should be trusted to control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But there is a simple, elegant solution that would keep the government open and likely benefit Republicans in the long run: Hand control of the House over to Democrats. </span><br /></p><p><span>Consider Johnson’s bind, which is the same one McCarthy faced. Republicans have an extraordinarily slim majority in the House; after George Santos’s December ouster and McCarthy’s retirement at the end of the year, it sits at just three votes. On January 21, that margin will </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4385589-house-gop-majority-to-shrink-to-2-with-ohio-lawmakers-early-resignation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shrink to just two</a><span> when Ohio Republican Bill Johnson retires. Because some within the GOP won’t vote for any spending deal that doesn’t contain draconian cuts, and because Democrats control the Senate and the White House, any agreement to keep the government open requires a bipartisan compromise.</span><br /></p><p><span>But compromise is anathema to many House Republicans. Rather than recognize reality—the absolute necessity of reaching across the aisle—they have embraced a fantasy: that their leader, not their slim majority, is the cause of their legislative incompetence. Johnson’s task is impossible: He has to keep the government open and keep his right flank happy. The problem is that he can’t do both. Thus, it seems increasingly inevitable that before too long either the government will shut down or Johnson will lose the gavel—or both. And whoever gets the gavel after Johnson will be in the same bind, probably with an even shorter leash. </span><br /></p><p><span>So the Republicans should unburden themselves of this responsibility, which they clearly can’t uphold anyway, and just give up the gavel to Democrats and dare them to do better.</span><br /></p><p>No, I don’t think the House GOP would ever do this, and yes, there are a few obvious caveats. Republicans have few—if any—legislative priorities, but they are <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173528/inside-gop-desperate-attempt-smear-joe-biden">dead set on using their slim majority</a> to investigate Joe Biden’s son Hunter in an attempt to deflect attention from Trump’s numerous criminal and civil trials. A Democrat, particularly current party leader Hakeem Jeffries, taking the gavel would not only be seen as a profound failure but as practically treasonous by the right-wing press. <br /></p><p><span>And yet, it’s hard to argue that it wouldn’t be preferable for House Republicans’ political goals to simply relinquish control. The government shutting down would be eminently bad for their chances of maintaining their narrow House majority; it would also likely damage Trump’s presidential chances, given that it would serve as a glaring reminder of the recklessness and incompetence of the Republican Party. </span><br /></p><p><span>Giving up control of the House would allow them to at least plead powerlessness. They could return to a defensive posture, accusing Biden and the Democrats of reckless spending, and wash their hands of any deal that funds the government through the 2024 election. As for the Hunter Biden investigation, there is an argument that holding off would benefit them politically as well. They could continue to prosecute the case in the media, as they have for the last four years, arguing that Democrats are covering up a massive corruption scandal—and promising once again to begin investigating the “Biden Crime Family” when they regain power. </span><br /></p><p><span>Holding off on the Hunter Biden investigation is beneficial in an additional way: They </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/9/28/23870322/biden-impeachment-hunter-shokin-big-guy-half-salary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don’t have the goods</a><span>. Despite grandiose claims of President Biden raking in millions in bribes via his drug-addled son, they have produced no evidence. The investigation is a massive embarrassment, and continuing it will only reinforce how flimsy and politically motivated it is. It may even make voters sympathetic to the president. And when Trump’s criminal and civil trials begin to heat up, it may ultimately backfire, presenting a contrast between a Republican presidential nominee who is guilty of multiple crimes—fraud, sexual assault, insurrection, among others—and a Democratic presidential nominee who is the victim of a political witch hunt (a real one). </span><br /></p><p>If Jeffries is unpalatable to the handful of Republicans needed to make him speaker—which is highly likely—a compromise could be found, with the New York Democrat remaining party leader but someone else becoming speaker. Democrats could offer a centrist choice from their own ranks (someone like Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger) or pull a moderate with bipartisan appeal from outside the chamber. There is, after all, no requirement that the speaker of the House be a member of the House. A NeverTrump Republican—think Liz Cheney or John Kasich—would be another option, though it’s hard to imagine such a politician being elected, given the likely defections from progressive Democrats and Republicans terrified of angering Trump and Fox News. Members of Congress could even get creative: Mark Cuban just <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/11/3-theories-on-what-mark-cubans-big-moves-mean.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sold the Dallas Mavericks and quit <i>Shark Tank</i></a> and presumably has a fair amount of time on his hands. <br /></p><p><span>Yes, my tongue is firmly in cheek at this point. But for a year now, House Republicans have been caught in a repetitive, self-destructive cycle. There is a seeming belief that if they only select a different speaker they will magically get a different outcome: a funding deal that keeps the government open while shrinking its size dramatically. They should face the facts: This simply will not happen. There’s only one way out of their current predicament, which is to acknowledge, at long last, that they have no business running the House of Representatives. Doing so may be the only way for them to hold onto their majority. </span><br /></p> <div>

<title>Carbon Offsets (Taylor’s Version)</title>

<div> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-again-under-fire-150048310.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">response</a><span> of Taylor Swift’s spokesperson to December </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/taylor-swift-coming-under-fire-co2-emissions-1854856" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a><span> that the pop star had generated 128 tons of carbon dioxide from private jet travel in just three months was simple: Before the start of her “Eras” tour in March 2023, “Taylor purchased more than double the carbon credits needed to offset all tour travel.”</span></p><p>This was a striking story for a few reasons. First, 128 tons of carbon dioxide is roughly equivalent to the average annual emissions of 28 gas-powered cars or 16 homes, per an Environmental Protection Agency emissions equivalency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">calculator</a>. Second, the source for these figures has since disappeared from the internet: The emissions numbers were reportedly calculated by an Instagram page called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taylor.flights/?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Taylor Swift’s Jets</a>, tracking journeys by her Desault Falcon 7x and Dessault Falcon 900. Shortly after major news outlets picked up the numbers, the page <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2023/12/taylor-swift-jets-planes-tracking-instagram" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disappeared</a> from the social media site.</p><p>But perhaps the most interesting aspect, from a climate perspective, is the pop star’s purchase of offsets to deflect criticism. In brief, carbon offset vendors claim to allow polluters to counteract emissions they generate by purchasing credits that correspond to emissions reductions elsewhere. Often, that means paying some entity—like a nonprofit or corporation—to preserve tracts of forests that would otherwise be cut down. Offsets are also sold by companies like Climeworks, which captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a process known as Direct Air Capture and stores it in geological formations. So which carbon offsets is Taylor Swift buying? </p><p><span>Universal, Swift’s record label, did not respond to an inquiry as to where Swift had purchased the offsets. High-quality offsets are extraordinarily hard to come by, though. Over the last several years, the industry has been </span><a href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/?utm_content=buffere3f18&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mired in controversy</a><span> over the validity of its claims: Are all of the lands companies claim to protect, for instance, actually in danger of being razed? Trees planted are also liable to die or be cut down at some point: While carbon generated by a private jet will remain in the atmosphere indefinitely, there’s virtually no way for credit vendors to ensure trees will stay standing for time immemorial. </span></p><p>“The entire market is structured around a fundamental falsehood: that a ton of carbon we get from burning fossil fuels is identical to a ton of carbon stored in forests. That is 100 percent false,” Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, whose research focuses on carbon offsets and storage, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/175773/popular-climate-solution-tank-progress">told</a> me in September. “If you store carbon for less time than it takes to stabilize temperatures, that storage does not have any climate benefit.”</p><p>One recent study, still undergoing peer review as of last September, estimated that just 12 percent of offset projects “constitute real emissions reductions.” Another <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/19/do-carbon-credit-reduce-emissions-greenhouse-gases" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">investigation</a> published last fall by<i> The Guardian</i> and the nonprofit watchdog Corporate Accountability concluded that 78 percent of the top 50 carbon-offsetting projects are “likely junk.” </p><p>Last month wasn’t the first time Swift’s jets have been in the news. A 2022 report from British “sustainability marketing firm” Yard named her the biggest celebrity polluter of the year. The firm found that Swift’s jet had spent the equivalent of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kylies-17-minute-flight-has-nothing-on-the-170-trips-taylor-swifts-private-jets-took-this-year-1390083/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">16 days</a> in the air during the first six months of that year. A spokesperson for the “Midnight” singer <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kylies-17-minute-flight-has-nothing-on-the-170-trips-taylor-swifts-private-jets-took-this-year-1390083/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> at the time that Swift frequently loaned out her planes to be used by others. </p><p>Many of the credits purchased by corporations—and potentially Swift—are validated by third parties meant to ensure those credits are legit. Those firms have also come under heavy fire. One 2023 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exposé</a> revealed that at least 90 percent of credits approved by one of the largest third-party verifiers, claiming offset projects in rainforests, were worthless “phantom credits” that didn’t correspond to any reductions. (The subject of the investigation, a nongovernmental organization called Verra, has disputed the allegations.)</p><p>There are <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/offset-disclosure-needs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">very few requirements</a> for companies or individuals that purchase offsets to publicly disclose where they come from. California passed a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1305" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">law</a> last year, Assembly Bill 1305, requiring “entities” that do business in the state and that buy or sell carbon credits, to make that information available. There’s been <a href="https://www.velaw.com/insights/californias-combatting-of-greenwashing-in-the-voluntary-carbon-market/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dispute</a> over whether the statute takes effect this year or in 2025, as the bill’s author has argued it does in recent weeks. Without additional information from Swift’s team, there’s little way of knowing whether Swift personally, Universal, or some other legal entity purchased the offsets, and, accordingly, whether whatever entity bought them would be subject to the new law once it takes effect.</p><p>“If Swift or her companies have publicly claimed that the tour was carbon neutral or that it produced less climate impact than its actual emissions because of offset credit use, then arguably they have made a claim that is covered under AB 1305,” Cullenward, who advocated for the bill’s passage, told me over text. </p><p>There’s still a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_Space" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blank space</a> to be filled in as to whether Taylor Swift’s carbon offsets are legit, but she does seem eager to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_It_Off" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shake off</a> her reputation as a climate villain. Swift might not need to come <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_(song)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clean</a> in the end. Carbon offset buyers and sellers in the Golden State, however, know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Too_Well" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all too well</a> that they’ll need to soon enough.</p> <div>

<title>The Fourteenth Amendment Scolds Abetting Trump’s Return</title>
<link>https://newrepublic.com/post/178025/fourteenth-amendment-media-abetting-trump</link>
<guid>https://newrepublic.com/post/178025/fourteenth-amendment-media-abetting-trump</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <p>The media spent a large part of Donald Trump’s presidency waiting for the moment that he might <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/donald-trump-presidential-tone-lasted-a-day-just-like-it-always-does" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">become presidential</a>. Like <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-literally-laughed-at-how-he-can-game-the-press-with-his-new-tone" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fools</a>, they manned this post in spite of the fact that Trump had very specifically refused to comport with one of the central notions of the constitutional order: that there are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-iowa-town-hall-d9cad413851b60f6c0abd2a564d86338" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reasonable limits on presidential power</a>. Trump was hardly the first to abjure the notion that the chief executive was in any way constrained, but he was perhaps the most flamboyant occupant of the Oval Office at flouting this norm—the weeks he spent cultivating and then inciting an attack on the Capitol being the ne plus ultra of his misrule.</p><p><span>A lack of accountability since then </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164706/january-6-riot-2024-election">has served our nation poorly</a><span>. Three years on from the January 6 insurrection, but before the primary elections have even begun, Republican lawmakers are already </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/08/republican-elise-stefanik-certifying-2024-election-results" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">refusing to commit to certifying this November’s winner</a><span>. I suppose the silver lining here is that there won’t be much violence a year from now—there’s no need to ransack a Capitol whose occupants have provided for its pillage in advance. </span></p><p><span>This week, however, Trump’s lawyers upped the stakes considerably, contending that the president </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/177937/trump-presidential-immunity-claim-could-cover-murder-rivals-defense">could not be prosecuted</a><span> for ordering SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political opponent, unless he was swiftly impeached by Congress and convicted for the crime in the Senate first. That’s cold comfort to Trump’s murdered rival, to say nothing of any impeachment-minded lawmakers, who in this infernal thought exercise would obviously be the next under the gun of Trump’s mercenaries.</span></p><p>We are, however, not completely unarmed against Trump’s thuggery: Article 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/174977/baude-paulsen-trump-14th-amendment">lays out a fail-safe</a>, disqualifying anyone who played a part in inciting an insurrection from holding office again. Unfortunately, while it is rare for the Supreme Court to disarm anyone, it will, in all likelihood, deny the American people this protection. But the Roberts court has been vastly aided and abetted by our political media, who after waiting so long for Trump to discover virtue, have quickly declared the Article 3 tool to be a vice—either searingly unfair to use in this instance or invalid on its face. When the decision eventually comes, the press will have created an environment in which the Supreme Court’s disregard for the Constitution’s text won’t be viewed as a radical act.</p><p>That this consensus was reached so quickly is something of a surprise, as the dominant mode of the pundit class is to venerate the Constitution as a peerless document, the final answer to all questions. As <i>The New Republic</i>’s Osita Nwanevu has written, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159823/constitution-crisis-supreme-court">this reverence may be unearned</a>. But the media has gone to strange lengths to specifically discount this one part of the Constitution that was designed to prevent the crisis we now face. </p><p><span>An indelible example of this rough treatment </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/us/maine-trump-ballot.html?smid=nytcore-android-share" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was published in <em>The New York Times</em></a><span> on December 28, the day that Maine’s secretary of state decided that a plain reading of Article 3 compelled her to remove Trump from her state’s ballot. The </span><em>Times</em><span> could not let the matter pass without injecting opinion into what purported to be a straight news story, referring to Article 3 in derogatory terms: “an obscure clause of a constitutional amendment enacted after the Civil War.” The Fourteenth Amendment, in toto, is about 400 words long. There are no “obscure” parts to it—no small-print footnotes stuffed away in the back pages or lost-to-memory secret lore that requires Nicolas Cage’s help to unearth.</span></p><p><span>Those who’ve been more up front about their opinion-mongering haven’t been any less meretricious in their treatment of Article 3. Writing for his newsletter, Indignity, Tom Scocca </span><a href="https://indignity.substack.com/p/overthrowing-the-insurrection-clause" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">provides a concise survey</a><span> of those who’ve recently endeavored to “pretend” that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn’t say what it says, from the “</span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/colorado-court-trump-disqualified-ballot-insurrection-case-against.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">half-baked excuses</a><span>” from pundits to the “</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/opinion/trump-colorado-ballot-ban.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feeble political claims</a><span>” of legal experts doing business as Constitution doubters. </span></p><p>One example that stands out for its sheer mendacity comes from Yale Law professor (and it’s almost always a Yale Law professor) Jed Rubenfeld, who <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-solution-to-the-trump-ballot-conundrum-griffin-colorado-us-supreme-court-6d6b64ef" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pooh-poohed Article 3</a> for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>’s opinion section, admonishing those who might wield it to save the country from harm that while the “Colorado Supreme Court didn’t exactly get the law wrong” when it plucked Trump from its ballot, the “problem” was “there was no law to get right,” on account of the fact that “almost no case law exists on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.” </p><p><span>Indeed, one of the big reasons that there’s precious little case law on that particular part of the Fourteenth Amendment is that it’s hitherto proven to be such an adequate bulwark against a president ordering an insurrection that hardly any presidents have tried it. It’s generally pretty hard to generate case law when everyone agrees not to break a law. But Rubenfeld’s reprimands ring pretty hollow if we must, at the first instance of this law being broken, concede that the plain text of the Constitution is invalid.</span></p><p><span>The most idiotic case against the Fourteenth Amendment solution is </span><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/why-we-should-recoil-from-the-14th-amendment-strategy-against-trump/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the one</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/opinion/trump-colorado-ballot-ban.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that’s been</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/21/trump-disqualified-14th-amendment-democracy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">made the</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/us/politics/trump-ballot-colorado-supreme-court.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">most often</a><span>: the idea that the people, and not judges, must decide Trump’s fate. As Kurt Lash recently scolded from the </span><em>New York Times</em><span> opinion page, this battle for the Republic </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/opinion/trump-section-3-14th-amendment.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">must take place in voting booths or not at all</a><span>: “Let the people make their own decision about Donald Trump.” </span></p><p>But where did Article 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment come from, if not “the people?” These words were ratified through the same democratic process as every other amendment to the Constitution. They weren’t put there by gods or monsters. Moreover, as <i>The New Republic</i> contributor Andrew Koppelman <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/177820/14th-amendment-trump-electoral-college">pointed out</a>, “The people” have, on two occasions now, unambiguously rejected Trump. In 2016, their decision was thwarted by the Electoral College; in 2020, Trump reacted to his Electoral College loss by trying to overthrow its decision through the corrupt means that this Constitutional amendment was specifically written to prevent. How many times do “the people” have to render a decision before they’re allowed to use the Constitution to enforce it?</p><p><span>There is every possibility that, this November, the American people will, for a third consecutive time, do exactly what Lash demands and again decide that Trump is unfit to rule. It will be well within the realm of possibility that the popular vote will once again be overruled by the Electoral College—or there may simply be enough Republicans on hand to deny the American people the right to the decision they’ve rendered. How will those chiding the effort to forestall this fate through lawful means account for themselves, should this come to pass? What is it about the broken America they’re helping to usher in through their empty, repetitive screeds that they find so appealing? Are the clicks really </span><em>that</em><span> good?</span></p><p> <i>This article first appeared in Power Mad, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Jason Linkins. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/politics?blinkaction=newsletter!Power_Mad_Newsletter">Sign up here</a>.</i></p> <div>

<title>John Fetterman Speaks: I Haven’t Changed a Lick</title>

<guid>https://newrepublic.com/article/177976/john-fetterman-interview-israel-progressive</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <p><span>All life evolves, even that of U.S. senators. John Fetterman is no exception, even if the junior senator from Pennsylvania insists he hasn’t changed a lick. “I’m not a progressive, I’m just a Democrat,” Fetterman said during an exclusive interview with </span><i>The New Republic </i><span>on Wednesday.</span></p><p>Some might beg to differ. In the past, he <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnFetterman/status/1330308163095179264" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tweeted</a>, “My dude, I’m a progressive Democrat.” He backed Bernie Sanders enthusiastically in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, saying of Sanders, “We stand together as the most progressive candidates in our respective races.” Many progressives expressed excitement in 2022 after he beat a more establishment-friendly Democrat in the primary and then flipped a Senate seat that Republicans had long held—even after suffering a near-fatal stroke a few months before.</p><p>But in recent months, that enthusiasm has given way to frustration and even anger from the left because of his outspoken support for Israel amid its overwhelming assault on Gaza after Hamas killed 1,200 people on October 7. He earned even more ire when he called for more restrictions on immigration as Republicans hope to close off people’s means to enter the United States legally in exchange for funding for Ukraine.<span> </span></p><p>And on Thursday, in a speech to a Jewish organization, he referenced charges of white genocide against South Africa, which has brought genocide charges against Israel before the International Court of Justice at The Hague, by <a href="https://gazette.com/news/wex/fetterman-urges-south-africa-to-sit-out-of-genocide-trial-against-israel/article_a6098886-58c3-5db4-9339-3c345ee86cca.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> that “maybe South Africa maybe ought to sit this one out when it comes to criticizing the behavior of other nations.” <span> </span></p><p>Fetterman later clarified his remarks Friday in a <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/john-fetterman-south-africa-israel-b2477217.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> to <i>The Independent.</i> “The entirety of my point was this: South Africa should instead focus on the spiraling humanitarian crises on its own continent—like Sudan, where more than 7 million people have been displaced with widespread atrocities,” he said.</p><p>Fetterman’s policy positions make some of his campaign supporters feel like he pulled a bait and switch. “As soon as he gets money from AIPAC, what does he do? He switches and says he’s never been a progressive,” said Tiana, one of a half-dozen protesters gathered outside Fetterman’s Senate office Monday.</p><p>Fetterman has received $244,100 from pro-Israel groups, but AIPAC has not contributed to the senator’s election campaigns, according to a review of OpenSecrets data from the last four years.</p><p>Tiana said she traveled from Washington, D.C., to volunteer for Fetterman’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania but has since left the Democratic Party over President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.<span> </span></p><p>Fetterman bristles at the notion that he’s somehow sold out progressives, insisting instead that he is the same person. “I vote on bedrock Democratic principles, and I’m not gonna leave my party,” Fetterman said.</p><p>Still, his recent pronouncements on Israel and the border have been surprising, to say the least. On Wednesday, <i>The New Republic </i>sat down with the senator for an exclusive interview about the evolution that he says has not occurred.<span> </span></p><p>He still uses the smartphone that he has used since suffering a stroke two years ago that dictates his speech and displays his words across a screen. In our interview, he pulled a phone from the right-side pocket of his black polyester gym shorts, opened a dictation app, and nodded for me to start speaking. Text of my speech cascaded down Fetterman’s screen in awkward stop-and-go intervals.</p><p><i>You … said you will never sell … out the Dreamers. Is relief for Dreamers … a condition of your support … for a potential border deal?</i></p><p>“I did say that,” Fetterman replied to the first part of the question. “Of course.…” There was a pause, and then he replied to the second part. “I can’t and would never vote against their interests,” said Fetterman of Dreamers. “How can we penalize children who were brought here and now are living their best lives? They’re making incredible contributions, and I’m married to one of them.”<span> </span></p><p>Gisele Barreto’s family emigrated illegally from Brazil when she was a 7-year-old, landing in New York City, where she grew up poor. In 2004, Barreto got her green card. She became a citizen five years later, shortly after marrying Fetterman, then the mayor of his hometown of Braddock, Pennsylvania.<span> </span></p><p>If he was trying to sound conciliatory on immigration, he was unapologetic on Israel. Asked if the Senate should put conditions on U.S. military aid to Israel, Fetterman didn’t waffle. “No, none,” he said. Images of the remaining Hamas hostages taken on October 7 hang along a wall in the front office of his Senate suite. On the wall opposite are images of Hamas hostages released. A steady stream of cease-fire advocates visit Fetterman’s office each day to demand that he do better. Staffers log their concerns and, in lieu of offering their agreement, instead give them tiny bottles of cold water from a mini-fridge on the floor and candy made in Hershey and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.<span> </span></p><p>“Standing with Israel and thinking that we should have a secure border, I don’t know why either one of them is controversial,” said Fetterman, who has indicated that he would support a bipartisan proposal backed by the White House to permanently restrict legal immigration to unlock Republican support in the Senate for Ukrainian military funding. “Ukraine is my priority—and Israel,” Fetterman told me back in December, a foreign policy position from which he has not budged.<span> </span></p><p>This much has to be admitted, though. As upset as his old progressive allies may be, his stances aren’t hurting him at home. In fact, the opposite is true. A Quinnipiac <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3888#:~:text=SENATOR%20FETTERMAN,-Roughly%20one%2Dquarter&amp;text=Roughly%20one%2Dthird%20of%20voters,on%20their%20view%20of%20him." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poll</a> of 600 Pennsylvania voters published January 10 showed that 26 percent of those surveyed said Fetterman’s support for Israel’s military offensive in Palestine improved their view of him, while only 14 percent said it made them see him more negatively (over half said it had no impact on their view). On immigration, the numbers were even more starkly in his favor, as 35 percent said his new harder line improved their view of him and just 9 percent said it made them think less favorably of him.<span> </span></p><p>Pennsylvania is a swing state, up for grabs by either party in November’s election. It has a significant Jewish population and a very popular Jewish governor in Josh Shapiro. But unlike Shapiro and Casey, who enjoy high approval numbers, Fetterman has struggled to get his own approval above 50 percent. The Quinnipiac poll had him at 45 percent.</p><p>But was Fetterman really as progressive as his detractors on the left now claim? As lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania in 2022, Fetterman <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/18/more-dem-senate-hopefuls-split-with-biden-on-border-00025925" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">argued</a> against lifting Title 42, the controversial pandemic-era authority that allowed federal agents to expel migrants from the country as public health threats. That same year, Fetterman <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/john-fetterman-says-hell-lean-in-on-u-s-israel-relationship-as-senator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told</a> <i>Jewish Insider </i>that he’s “not really a progressive” on the issue of Israel. “Our campaign is based on core Democratic values and principles, and always has been, and there is no daylight between myself and these kinds of unwavering commitments to Israel’s security,” he said.</p><p>Democratic activist Brett Goldman noted at the time that Fetterman had “never come out and said that he’s not a supporter of Israel,” despite the public perception that Fetterman would eventually align with progressives if elected to the Senate. “That may not be true, but that’s what the perception is,” <a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/john-fetterman-says-hell-lean-in-on-u-s-israel-relationship-as-senator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> Goldman, a remark that presaged the progressive disillusionment with Fetterman today.</p><p>“Last question,” I said. “OK, fine,” he replied, nodding his consent, then fixing his unblinking eyes on his smartphone screen. Speaking slowly, I watched my question cascade down his screen, not all at once, but again in broken intervals.</p><p><i>Beyond … border security what … specifically is your ideal migrant policy package … relating to migrant rights? Or even just at a … high level?</i></p><p>Fetterman paused for a five-count, staring up the East Grand Stairs of the Senate, giving me a hard side-eye, before taking a deep breath and speaking in a slow, careful cadence. “Look,” he said, “ideally we honor where America has historically been with immigration. Ideally we would protect Dreamers and give them a franchise. They need to be citizens.” Excitedly I pointed back at his phone for a follow-up.<br /> <br /> “<i>Then … what is your message … for your Republican colleagues who see … no distinction between …?”</i></p><p>Fetterman stopped reading, slid his phone into the kangaroo pouch of his black cotton hoodie. “I’ve been told that they’re not going to be put in harm’s way, but if the border talks did put them in harm’s way, I can never and would never vote against their interest,” he said. <br /> <br /> “To be clear,” he continued. “I’m not calling for deporting hundreds of thousands or millions of people, or that kind of thing. That’s not who we are. We have to secure our border, but I want every immigrant to have their own American dream. OK?”<span> </span></p><p>“Got it,” I exhaled loudly, realizing only then I’d been holding my breath, hanging on his every syllable. “Thank you, Senator.” Fetterman offered me an awkward handshake before abruptly shuffling away toward the entrance of the Senate chamber. “Yeah, thanks,” he muttered as he walked by me.<span> </span></p><p>This was new. Fetterman had finally declared his alignment with promises Gisele made to migrant communities (and Latino press) on the campaign trail, that her husband John would fight for them. “I know what it’s like to live in limbo,” Gisele <a href="https://www.latinorebels.com/2022/09/20/fettermansenate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told me</a> while John recovered from his stroke in September 2022. “John has seen my journey, my family’s journey as immigrants to this country.”</p><p>All senators evolve, even John Fetterman, but has he actually moved rightward on Israel and border security? Or is this who he was all along, just no one bothered to ask for the details? Fetterman arrived in the Senate with a reputation for being a straight shooter, a no-bullshit small-town guy from a steel town with a foul mouth, a migrant wife, a closet full of gym clothes.<span> </span></p><p>Has Fetterman sold out the progressive supporters who elected him? Or did his supporters simply ignore the early warning signs that Fetterman was never going to join the Squad when he got to the Senate? Both can be true, but the evidence suggests that Fetterman’s positions on Israel and border security have been consistent all along, he’s just finally being asked to articulate them.</p><p>The bad news for Fetterman’s haters is that now they’re stuck with him for another five years. Meanwhile, the junior senator from Pennsylvania now has the rest of his freshman term in the Senate to navigate the tricky path of “evolving” without being seen as betraying core values that got him elected in the first place.</p> <div>

<title>Kansas Legislators to Kansas Voters: You Spoke Loud and Clear, and We Don’t Care</title>
<link>https://newrepublic.com/post/178097/kansas-republicans-bill-overturn-voters-abortion</link>
<guid>https://newrepublic.com/post/178097/kansas-republicans-bill-overturn-voters-abortion</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <p><span>Republican lawmakers in </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/170137/kansas-republican-abortion-ban-state"><span>Kansas</span></a><span> want to make sure you know they don’t care about the will of the voters. State representatives have introduced a bill completely banning abortion, despite Kansans </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/167164/kansas-first-state-vote-abortion-amendment-post-roe-primary"><span>voting</span></a><span> less than two years ago to keep protections for the procedure in the state constitution.</span></p><p><span>House Bill 2492 was </span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/hb2492/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>introduced</span></a><span> Wednesday by eight Republican state representatives, seven of whom are men. The measure would ban all abortions except those necessary to save the patient’s life. </span></p><p><span>The bill </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/01/11/house-gop-lawmakers-introduce-bill-imposing-near-total-ban-on-abortion-in-kansas/#:~:text=Under+the+House+bill,+Kansas,t+include+such+an+exemption.?link_id=1&amp;can_id=5997f2467832a8daa24afac4b6dd7175&amp;source=email-roundup-the-democratic-legislative-campaign-committee-launches-2024-roadmap-memo-outlining-path-to-victory-and-record-breaking-fundraising-pace&amp;email_referrer=email_2169432&amp;email_subject=breaking-kansas-republicans-introduce-near-total-abortion-ban-undermining-2022-referendum-vote-to-keep-abortion-legal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>bans</span></a><span> prescribing, distributing, selling, or donating abortion medication. Anyone who helps someone get an abortion could face civil proceedings, while doctors who perform abortions would face a minimum fine of $10,000 per procedure.</span></p><p><span>The measure flies directly in the face of the will of the voters, as noted by Amber Sellers, the advocacy director of Trust Women, a pro-abortion nonprofit in Wichita, Kansas. “Kansans spoke—loudly—on the issue,” Sellers told the Kansas Reflector. “It’s time for anti-abortion lawmakers to wake up, remember and finally listen to the message that voters continue to send.”</span></p><p><span>In August 2022, less than two months after the Supreme Court overturned </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/169594/political-earthquake-year-2022-fall-roe"><span>Roe v. Wade</span></a><span>, Kansans </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/kansas-votes-on-abortion-rights-in-us-test-case-01659418506" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>voted overwhelmingly</span></a><span> to keep language in the state constitution protecting the right to abortion. The vote proved to be a bellwether, with multiple states voting to increase abortion protections since.</span></p><p><span>But that didn’t stop Kansas Republican lawmakers from trying to circumvent the will of the people. The Sunflower State GOP has tried to pass a bill that would let </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/170108/kansas-republicans-bill-ban-abortion-voters"><span>local governments</span></a><span> of individual towns and cities ban abortion, as well as a bill that would force doctors to </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/171492/kansas-house-passes-bill-force-doctors-lie-patients-abortion-pill"><span>lie to their patients</span></a><span> about abortion medication. Both measures were ultimately unsuccessful.</span></p><p><span>And just as the Kansas vote turned out to be an indicator of what voters wanted nationwide, so too have Republicans in other states followed the Kansas GOP’s model. Most recently, Ohio residents </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/176735/ohio-voters-protect-abortion-rights-election"><span>voted</span></a><span> in November to enshrine abortion protections in the state constitution. Ohio Republican lawmakers immediately set about finding ways to enact legislation that would </span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/176876/ohio-republicans-plan-sabotage-abortion-election-results"><span>undermine</span></a><span> the results.</span></p><p><span>If the Kansas bill passes the state legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, it will likely be vetoed by Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. The GOP does have a large enough majority to override Kelly’s veto, but the abortion ban is unlikely to survive a legal challenge. The state Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/26/717449336/kansas-supreme-court-rules-state-constitution-protects-right-to-abortion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span>ruled</span></a><span> in 2019 that the Kansas constitution protects abortion rights, meaning the bill violates those rights.</span></p> <div>
